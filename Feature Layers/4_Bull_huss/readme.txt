Bull Huss distribution is based on landings 2019-2022, survey (the Irish Ground Fish Survey), and Inland Fisheries Ireland Marine Sportfish Tagging Programme. These data were coded as presence/absence (there are zeros in the landings data). Distributions were then interpolated by Kriging as a suitable variogram was fit to the spatial data (details and rationale are same as Blonde Ray described above).
