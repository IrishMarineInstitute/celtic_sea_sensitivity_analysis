Blonde Ray distribution is based on landings 2018-2022, survey data (Irish Coastal Ecosystem survey, the Irish Anglerfish and Megrim Survey, the Irish Ground Fish Survey, and Inland Fisheries Ireland trawl survey), Inland Fisheries Ireland Marine Sportfish Tagging Programme, and stakeholder data (NBDC, Sea Angling Ireland). These data are heterogenous in terms of effort, units, season and survey type (including gear type). After examining the data, the different sources were coded as presence/absence (there are zeros in the landings data). This was felt to give the best representation, based on the existing data, of a broadly distributed fish. Distributions were then interpolated by Kriging after a suitable variogram was fit to the spatial data. The best-fitting model was chosen from exponential, Matern, spherical, and gaussian alternatives. A pure nugget model was also fitted, with interpolation only carried out when a model superior to nugget (no spatial dependence) existed. Kriging was carried out using gstat (Pebesma, 2004; Gr√§ler et al., 2016) in R.
