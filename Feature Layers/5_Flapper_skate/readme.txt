Data available from the Irish Specimen Fish Committee Specimen dataset, Inland Fisheries Ireland Marine Sportfish Tagging Programme were filtered such that only females â‰¥197.5 cm total length, which is the size at which 50% of female individuals are considered mature (Ellis et al 2024), were mapped. This filter is based on the assumption that reproductive females are amenable to spatial protection owing to site residency during lay periods and interannual site fidelity. There was no relevant data from the ICES survey data in the area of interest that met the filter criterion. A polygon was drawn from Mizen Head to the Old Head of Kinsale that encompassed all but the most southerly data point (which was a considerable outlier).
