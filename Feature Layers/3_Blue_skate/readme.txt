Data available from the French Southern Atlantic Bottom Trawl Survey (ICES-FR-EVHOE), the Irish Anglerfish and Megrim Survey (IE-IAMS), and the Irish Ground Fish Survey (IE-IGFS) were filtered such that only juveniles less than or equal to 28 cm total length, which is the cut off size above which individuals are no longer considered early stage juveniles (ESJ) (Ellis et al., 2024), were mapped; with 80% of ESJ catches captured by a convex hull polygon drawn that excluded the seven most northerly mapped points. This polygon was used to describe the distribution of early stage juvenile blue skate, which under a precautionary approach, are assumed to be amenable to spatial protection due to their small size and supposed residency in discrete areas (Delaval et al., 2022). Adult blue skate had a much broader distribution (not shown) but were not considered amenable to spatial protection due to difficulties in distinguishing sexually mature female blue skate (that might be amenable to spatial protection) from among available skate records.
