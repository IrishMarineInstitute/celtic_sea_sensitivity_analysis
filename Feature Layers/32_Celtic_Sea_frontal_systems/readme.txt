Raster layers of delta T (temperature) through the water column were generated using monthly output from a ROMS model in the Celtic Sea. New layers of variance in Delta T across a 3x3 neighbourhood of each cell were generated using an R script, and the monthly variance summed into a single raster layer. Areas with highest variance were selected as presence of front, with a filling algorithm used to select small gaps among selected cells. The raster layer was converted to a binary layer and then split into two layers: an eastern layer that described the Celtic Sea Front, and a western layer that described the coastal front.
