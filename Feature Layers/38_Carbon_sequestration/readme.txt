A machine learning approach was used to predict organic carbon (OC) content and stock (i.e., two layers pertaining to carbon sequestration) in the area of interest (AOI) in the Celtic Sea. The random forest model was trained on surficial sediment (upper 10 cm) data across the Northwest European Shelf, which were compiled from public repositories, government agencies, published literature and private consultancies. Predictor data for the Northwest European Shelf were sourced from the Copernicus marine data store1 and previously published scientific literature. The resulting model was used to predict organic content across the Northwest European Shelf and then clipped to the specific area of interest in the Celtic Sea. Dry Bulk Density, which is used to calculate organic carbon stock from organic carbon content (Diesing et al. 2017), was also sourced from previously published literature. Organic carbon stock for each pixel of organic carbon content was calculated from the formula: OC stock (kg m-2) = OC content (%) * Dry Bulk Density (g cm-3) * 0.1 (Depth in metres) (Diesing et al. 2017). It is acknowledged that spatial predictions of organic carbon content and stock carry certain assumptions and limitations. Of the >16,000 data points of organic carbon across the Northwest European Shelf, only 15 points fell within the AOI. Therefore, there is an underlying assumption that the model’s ‘learned’ relationships will still hold in the AOI where organic carbon has not been measured. However, Meyer and Pebesma (2021) developed the Area of Applicability (AOA), to test where machine learning models may be able to accurately predict and, according to the AOA concept, the model trained here is robust for the AOI. In addition, varying estimates of dry bulk density have been shown to have a significant effect on overall organic carbon stock estimates (Chatting et al. 2024) and in situ measurement data of dry bulk density for the Northwest European Shelf are limited.
