Salmon rivers that empty into the Celtic Sea AOI were identified using the Water Framework Directive Rivers Fish Ecological Status 2008-2022 and the 2003 National Seapoint datasets from Inland Fisheries Ireland. The list of rivers (presented in the Salmon case report, Appendix 10) was used to filter the estuaries/transitional water bodies layer. A 500 m buffer was applied to these identified estuary boundaries to ensure that they were captured by the 1 km planning grid.
