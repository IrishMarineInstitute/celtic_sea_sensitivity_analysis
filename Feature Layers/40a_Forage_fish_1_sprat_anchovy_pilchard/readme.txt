This dataset attempts to identify areas where this assemblage of mobile, shorter lived species are consistently observed using data from the annual Celtic Sea Herring Acoustic Survey (CSHAS, 2014-2023 incl.). Counts of all acoustic registrations of any of the species were gridded to the 1x1 km planning units and filtered to >4 observations per cell over the time-series to identify cells where forage fish are consistently present in autumn. The survey uses parallel transects and some artefacts of this are visible in the final layer.
