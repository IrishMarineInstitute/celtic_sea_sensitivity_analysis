Sandeel are more appropriately surveyed using bottom contacting, ground-fishing gear so international scientific bottom trawl and beam trawl survey data were used (Lynam & Ribiero, 2022). Densities per square kilometre of all sandeel species (Ammodytes tobianus, Ammodytidae sp., Hyperoplus immaculatus, Hyperoplus lanceolatus) were available from fixed survey stations from 2014-2020. The resulting layer was logged to reduce the effect of one station with very high density. A second layer was available from Inland Fisheries Ireland but this was presence / absence only. To combine this with the initial layer, presence cell values were set to the median cell value of the initial layer and the two layers summed. A small buffer was added to the data using the R command ‘focal’.
