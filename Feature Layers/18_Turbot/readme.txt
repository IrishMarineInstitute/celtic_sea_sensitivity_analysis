Turbot is based on landings 2018-2022 and survey data (Irish Anglerfish and Megrim Survey, Irish Ground Fish Survey), and data points from the National Biodiversity Data Centre. Data were coded as presence/absence (there are zeros in the landings data). Distributions were then interpolated by Kriging as a suitable variogram was fit to the spatial data (details and rationale are same as Blonde Ray described above).
