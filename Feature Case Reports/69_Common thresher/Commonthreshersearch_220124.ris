AB  - Historically, the Mediterranean Sea supported a rich shark fauna. Presently, however, populations of most shark species have significantly declined, largely due to intense fishing pressure. Interviews with crew members of bottom trawlers, drifting longliners and bottom longliners operating off the Costa Brava (Catalonia, NE Spain) were conducted between October 2016 and July 2017 in order to gather information on the current bycatch rate of several shark species. Interviews covered 41.2% of the fleet and respondents were asked for the bycatch of selected shark species-Alopias vulpinus, Cetorhinus maximus, Galeorhinus galeus, Hexanchus griseus, Isurus oxyrinchus, Mustelus spp., Prionace glauca, and Squalus acanthias-in two distinct time periods. Bottom trawlers captured the highest diversity of species (eight) followed by bottom longliners (seven), and drifting longliners (three). Most respondents (89.7%) declared having captured at least one shark from 2006 to 2016 but only 56.4% declared having captured at least one shark from 2016 to 2017. From 2016 to 2017, the whole fleet captured 89 specimens of H. griseus (95% confidence interval (CI) = 145, 34), 14 of G. galeus (95% CI = 30, 0), 3 of A. vulpinus (95% CI = 8, 0), 3 of I. oxyrinchus (95% CI = 8, 0), 3 of C. maximus (95% CI = 6, 0), and no Mustelus spp. The total bycatch of P. glauca and S. acanthias was uncertain due to extremely loose confidence intervals. A significant decline was perceived by fishermen in the bycatch of C. maximus and S. acanthias, whereas the bycatch of H. griseus was considered to have remained stable. This study suggests a dramatic reduction in the abundance of most of the medium-sized and large sharks of the Costa Brava and the likely disappearance of Mustelus spp. from the area. Only H. griseus, S. acanthias, and P. glauca are still being bycaught frequently.

AB  - Between 2007 and 2022, 112 specimens of newborn and young pelagic sharks were recorded in the waters of Tuscany Region, in the South Ligurian-North Tyrrhenian Seas (north-western Mediterranean basin). The sharks belonged to the Carcharhinus plumbeus (n = 14), Prionace glauca (n = 66), Isurus oxyrinchus (n = 16), Mobula mobular (n = 5) Alopias vulpinus (n = 7) and Hexanchus griseus (n = 4) species. Each animal was correctly identified thanks to the photographs or videos collected. All specimens were incidentally captured with set nets in inshore shallow waters, except bluntnose six-gill sharks, which were bycatch of deep-water bottom-trawl fishery. Body mass, sex, total length and biometric measurements were recorded in 34 baby sharks following the Mediterranean Large Elasmobranches Monitoring (MEDLEM) protocol. The presence of very evident and often non-healed umbilical scar confirmed that some of the sample specimens were newborn. Further confirmation came from the comparison between the total length observed and the size at birth known for the sampled species as reported in the literature. Some baby sharks were preserved in the Museums of Natural History of Pisa and Florence University collections. The importance of the coastal area studied as a possible shark nursery is discussed.

AB  - Haemoglobin (Hb)-O2 binding affinity typically decreases with increasing temperature, but several species of ectothermic and regionally endothermic fishes exhibit reduced Hb thermal sensitivity. Regionally endothermic sharks, including the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) and lamnid sharks such as the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), can maintain select tissues and organs warmer than ambient temperature by retaining metabolic heat with vascular heat exchangers. In the ectothermic bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), diurnal movements above and below the thermocline subject the tissues, including the blood, to a wide range of operating temperatures. Therefore, blood-O2 transport must occur across internal temperature gradients in regionally endothermic species, and over the range of environmental temperatures encountered by the ectothermic bigeye thresher shark. While previous studies have shown temperature-independent Hb-O2 affinity in lamnid sharks, including shortfin mako, the Hb-O2 affinity of the common and bigeye thresher sharks is unknown. Therefore, we examined the effect of temperature on whole-blood Hb-O2 affinity in common thresher shark and bigeye thresher shark. For comparison, analyses were also conducted on the shortfin mako shark and two ectothermic species, blue shark (Prionace glauca) and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). Blood-O2 binding affinity was temperature independent for common thresher shark and shortfin mako shark, which should prevent internal temperature gradients from negatively affecting blood-O2 transport. Blue shark and spiny dogfish blood-O2 affinity decreased with increasing temperature, as expected, but bigeye thresher shark blood exhibited both a reduced temperature dependence and a high Hb-O2 affinity, which likely prevents large changes in environment temperature and low environmental oxygen from affecting O2 uptake.

AB  - Alopias is a group of lamniform sharks characterized by a highly elongate caudal fin with three known extant species: Alopias pelagicus (pelagic thresher shark), Alopias superciliosus (bigeye thresher shark), and Alopias vulpinus (common thresher shark). Alopias pelagicus and A. vulpinus are considered fast swimmers and use their caudal fin to hunt for small schooling fish by stunning them, but this feeding behavior has never been directly observed for A. superciliosus. In this study, we examined four integumentary variables of selected fast swimming (e.g. A. pelagicus, A. vulpinus, and Lamna) and slow swimming (e.g. Mitsukurina and Megachasma) lamniform sharks to determine whether A. superciliosus is a fast swimmer or a slow swimmer. Our data indicate that A. superciliosus is a slow swimming lamniform, but it probably employs a simple laterally directed tail slap to capture its prey. Overall, our study points to an interpretation that A. superciliosus is an ambush predator, rather than an active prey-pursuing hunter. Mapping of scale data onto previously published phylogenetic trees indicate that slow swimming is a plesiomorphic condition in the order Lamniformes. Our work represents the most extensive comparative study of the morphology and variation of integumentary structures, especially placoid scales, conducted so far for Lamniformes.

AB  - This paper reports on a survey carried out in waters near Marshall Islands and on the analysis of catch rates of bigeye thresher shark, Alopias superciliosus, and thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus. The optimum swimming depth, water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen range of bigeye thresher sharks were identified as 240-360 m, 10-16 degrees C, 34.5-34.7 and 3.0-4.0 ml/l, respectively, while for thresher sharks they were 160-240 m, 18-20 degrees C, 34.5-34.8 and 1.0-1.5 ml/l, respectively, during daytime. The bigeye thresher shark and thresher shark were widely distributed in areas where the dissolved oxygen was higher than 0.5 ml/l. Some mitigation measures were recommended to reduce the bycatch of bigeye thresher shark and thresher shark, including avoiding fishing in peak areas and periods of shark abundance, using fish as bait and using nylon monofilament leaders. Furthermore, the hook depth data could be input into the 'habitat model' to standardise the shark catch per unit effort (CPUE).

AB  - A more medial and anterior position of the red aerobic myotomal muscle (RM) and the presence of a vascular counter-current heat exchange system provide the functional elements that facilitate regional RM endothermy in tunas, lamnid sharks and the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus). The convergent RM morphology among all species capable of RM endothermy suggests that RM position is a strong predictor of fish endothermic capacity. The present study investigated the comparative RM morphology of the other two thresher shark species (bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus, and the pelagic thresher, Alopias pelagicus), for which there is no information regarding their capacity for RM endothermy, and compared these data with published works on A. vulpinus. The digitization of transverse sections along the body of A. superciliosus and A. pelagicus enabled quantification of the relative amount of RM and the position and placement of the RM along the body. The RM in both A. superciliosus and A. pelagicus is positioned subcutaneously, along the lateral edges of the myotomes, and is distributed relatively evenly over the trunk of the body. The position of maximum RM area is at 50% fork length (FL) for A. superciliosus and at 75% FL for A. pelagicus. The amount of RM (mean +/- S.E.M.) is 2.31 +/- 0.11% and 3.01 +/- 0.10% in A. superciliosus and A. pelagicus, respectively. When compared with A. vulpinus, all three alopiid sharks have a similar amount of RM. However, A. superciliosus and A. pelagicus differ from A. vulpinus in that they do not possess the medial and anterior RM arrangement that would likely facilitate metabolic heat conservation (RNI endothermy).

AB  - The thresher sharks comprise a single family (Alopiidae) of pelagic sharks most easily recognized by the elongate dorsal lobe of their caudal fin. Despite morphological similarities among the alopiids, the common thresher (Alopias vulpinus) is unique in that its red, aerobic myotomal muscle (RM) is medially positioned (i.e., closer to the vertebrae), its systemic blood is supplied through a lateral circulation which give rise to counter-current heat exchanging retia, and it is capable of regional RM endothermy. Despite this information, it remains unknown if the other two alopiid species (bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus and pelagic thresher, Alopias pelagicus) also possess some or all of the characteristics related to regional RM endothermy. Thus, this study aimed to 1) document the presence of vascular specializations necessary for heat retention and RM endothermy and 2) measure the in vivo muscle temperatures of all three alopiid species. Laboratory dissections of the thresher species showed that only A. vulpinus possesses the lateral branching of the dorsal aorta giving rise to a lateral subcutaneous circulation and retial system, and that RM temperatures are elevated relative to ambient temperature. By contrast, both A. pelagicus and A. superciliosus have a similar systemic blood circulation pathway, in which the dorsal aorta and postcardinal vein form the basis for the central circulation and in vivo RM temperature measurements closely matched those of the ambient temperature at which the sharks were captured. Collectively, the vascular anatomy and in vivo temperature data suggest that only one species of thresher shark (A. vulpinus) possesses the requisite vascular specializations (i.e., lateral subcutaneous vessels and retia mirabilia) that facilitate RM endothermy.

AB  - Gill morphometrics of the three thresher shark species (genus Alopias) were determined to examine how metabolism and habitat correlate with respiratory specialization for increased gas exchange. Thresher sharks have large gill surface areas, short water-blood barrier distances, and thin lamellae. Their large gill areas are derived from long total filament lengths and large lamellae, a morphometric configuration documented for other active elasmobranchs (i.e., lamnid sharks, Lamnidae) that augments respiratory surface area while limiting increases in branchial resistance to ventilatory flow. The bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus, which can experience prolonged exposure to hypoxia during diel vertical migrations, has the largest gill surface area documented for any elasmobranch species studied to date. The pelagic thresher shark, A. pelagicus, a warm-water epi-pelagic species, has a gill surface area comparable to that of the common thresher shark, A. vulpinus, despite the latter's expected higher aerobic requirements associated with regional endothermy. In addition, A. vulpinus has a significantly longer water-blood barrier distance than A. pelagicus and A. superciliosus, which likely reflects its cold, well-oxygenated habitat relative to the two other Alopias species. In fast-swimming fishes (such as A. vulpinus and A. pelagicus) cranial streamlining may impose morphological constraints on gill size. However, such constraints may be relaxed in hypoxia-dwelling species (such as A. superciliosus) that are likely less dependent on streamlining and can therefore accommodate larger branchial chambers and gills.

AB  - An ecological risk assessment (ERA; also known as productivity and susceptibility analysis, PSA) was conducted on eleven species of pelagic elasmobranchs (10 sharks and 1 ray) to assess their vulnerability to pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean. This was a level-3 quantitative assessment consisting of a risk analysis to evaluate the biological productivity of these species and a susceptibility analysis to assess their propensity to capture and mortality in pelagic longline fisheries. The risk analysis estimated productivity (intrinsic rate of increase, r) using a stochastic Leslie matrix approach that incorporated uncertainty in age at maturity, lifespan, age-specific natural mortality and fecundity. Susceptibility to the fishery was calculated as the product of four components, which were also calculated quantitatively: availability of the species to the fleet, encounterability of the gear given the species vertical distribution, gear selectivity and post-capture mortality. Information from observer programs by several ICCAT nations was used to derive fleet-specific susceptibility values. Results indicated that most species of pelagic sharks have low productivities and varying levels of susceptibility to pelagic longline gear. A number of species were grouped near the high-risk area of the productivity-susceptibility plot, particularly the silky (Carcharhinus falciformis), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), and bigeye thresher (Alopias superciliosus) sharks. Other species, such as the oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus) and longfin mako (Isurus paucus) sharks, are also highly vulnerable. The blue shark (Prionace glauca) has intermediate vulnerability, whereas the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), and porbeagle (Lamna nasus) sharks are less vulnerable, and the pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) and common thresher (Alopias vulpinus) sharks have the lowest vulnerabilities. As a group, pelagic sharks are particularly vulnerable to pelagic longline fisheries mostly as a result of their limited productivity.

AB  - The common thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus, has shown a marked decline in abundance in the Mediterranean Sea. Through the analysis of long-term fishery time series (1966-2013), this study highlights that an important driver of the presence of A. vulpinus in the northern Adriatic Sea, one of the most exploited basins of the Mediterranean, is the abundance of its prey, the sardine Sardina pilchardus. From 1997-2013, an annual average of 14 thresher sharks was landed at Chioggia (Italy), the main fish market in the area, mainly from July to October. More than 75% of the landed thresher sharks were sexually immature, with some specimens weighing less than 10 kg, indicating that a high proportion of the catch was composed of small young and newborn individuals. These results support the occurrence of a nursery area in the northern Adriatic Sea, highlighting the need for proper management of A. vulpinus catch in this area.

AB  - Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) plays an important role in Portuguese fisheries. Portuguese commercial swordfish landings were analyzed from 1986 to 2012. Commercial landings of five incidental catches of pelagic sharks-bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus), shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), blue shark (Prionace glauca), and smooth hammerhead shark (Sphyrna zygaena)-were also evaluated for the same period. A total of 653 landings of swordfish (12,625 t) were observed in 62 ports. Annual landings for the fishery generally decreased over time, with a corresponding increase in price per kilogram. The most fished shark was blue shark, with 12,715 t in 48 ports. It was followed by shortfin mako, thresher, smooth hammerhead, and bigeye thresher (with 5113 t, 672 t, 19 t, and 0.45 t, respectively). Lowest landings of swordfish were observed in the first semester of each year, while catch levels of blue sharks were high during the same period. Shortfin mako catches did not raise until 2005. The remaining species studied always displayed lower landings, suggesting that most of them are bycaught.

AB  - The arterial supply to the eyes and brain of the common thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus, was examined and compared with that of five other lamniform shark species. Temperatures of the eyes and brain in two of these species were shown in previous studies to be higher than ambient. This was considered to be correlated with the presence of an orbital rete mirabile derived from the hyoidean efferent and pseudobranchial arteries. This study shows that the pseudobranchial artery forms a rete in only one of the two species previously shown to be warm, indicating that the brain of the other species is warmed by a non-retial vessel. This finding raises the possibility of brain and eye warming in Alopias vulpinus, which lacks an orbital rete mirabile.

AB  - The common thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus, is the basis of the largest commercial shark fishery in California waters. We used acoustic telemetry to determine the diel movement patterns and habitat preferences of this species in the Southern California Bight (SCB), where commercial fishing for the common thresher shark is concentrated. Eight common threshers (fork length: 122-203 cm) were tagged with temperature and depth-sensing acoustic transmitters and tracked for periods ranging from 22 to 49 h. Tracked sharks preferentially utilized deep offshore waters, and avoided shallower waters over the continental shelf. Mean rate of movement (ROM +/- s.d.) was 2.15 +/- 0.46 km h(-1). ROM and angular concentration (r, a measure of relative linearity) both showed a strong daytime pattern, with highest values at dawn that decreased throughout the day, whereas nocturnal ROM and r were less variable. Daytime vertical movements consisted of either vertical excursions below the thermocline or relatively level swimming within the upper portion of the thermocline. Nocturnally, all sharks remained within the mixed layer. These findings suggest that the common thresher shark is primarily a daytime predator, and have relevance for estimating how the alteration of the set depth of fishing-gear could affect catch rates of this species in the SCB.

AB  - The common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) is the focus of a popular southern California recreational fishery that targets individuals using multiple fishing gears and techniques. Despite increasing trends in the use of catch and release techniques in the recreational fishery for thresher sharks, a comprehensive estimate of post-release survival is not available for all modes of capture. This study focused on assessing post-release survival in two modes of capture routinely observed in the southern California recreational fishery: (1) sharks that are caught using caudal-based angling techniques and unintentionally released with trailing gear left embedded and (2) sharks that are caught and released using mouth-based angling techniques. Post-release survivorship was assessed using pop-up satellite archival tags programed for 10-and 90-day deployments, with the former used for mouth-caught sharks and the latter for individuals with trailing gear. Post-release survivorship estimates for the trailing gear studies were based on data from nine common thresher sharks (111-175 cm FL) while the mouth-based experiments utilized data from an additional seven sharks (125-187 cm fork length, FL). For the trailing gear studies, six sharks died within 5 days after release, one died after 81 days, and two sharks survived the deployment period for an overall survivorship rate of 22%. All seven mouth-hooked common thresher sharks survived the acute (similar to 10 days) effects of capture (100% survivorship). These results suggest that in the southern California recreational thresher shark fishery, caudal-based angling techniques, which often result in trailing gear left embedded in the shark, can negatively affect post-release survivorship. This work also reveals that mouth-based angling techniques can, when performed properly, result in high survivorship of released sharks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reports on the in vivo temperature measurements for slow-twitch, red aerobic muscle (RM) and fast twitch, white muscle (WM) of 24 Common Thresher Sharks, Alopias vulpinus, captured off the coast of Southern California. Mean ( SE) RM temperature elevation was 2.33 +/- 0.30 C warmer than the ambient sea surface temperature (SST, 19.13 +/- 0.22 C) and 2.25 +/- 0.35 C warmer than the coldest WM temperature measured (19.23 +/- 0.30 C). The maximum RM temperature elevation was 5.4 C above SST and up to 7.6 C above the WM. Nine Common Thresher Sharks exhibited RM temperatures that exceeded 3.0 C above SST. No significant relationship was found between fish total length and RM temperature elevation. Although there was individual variability in RM temperature elevation, this study documents that the Common Thresher Shark is capable of significantly elevating its RM temperature above that of the ambient conditions.

AB  - Reproductive organs from 130 male and 256 female Common Thresher Sharks Alopias vulpinus were examined to describe the reproductive characteristics and determine size at maturity and reproductive seasonality for the species in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Males ranged in size from 78 to 237cm FL and females ranged from 62 to 263cm FL. The onset of maturity in males was best described by an inflection in the relationship of clasper length to FL in combination with the degree of clasper calcification. Males matured between 181 and 198cm FL, and estimated median size at maturity was 188cm FL. In females, changes in the relationship between ovary and uterus length and width with FL were used to estimate the size at maturity. Females matured between 208 and 224cm FL; the estimated median size at maturity was 216cm FL. Litter sizes averaged 3.7 young. The period of parturition is protracted, spanning late spring to late summer (May-August). As in other Lamniformes, young are nourished through oophagy. The proportion of mature females in the resting, pregnant, and postpartum stages provides evidence that indicates that the Common Thresher Shark does not reproduce annually.

AB  - Within the fields of biology and ecology, animal movement is arguably one of the most basic, and yet, often one of the most difficult areas of study. Where and why animals migrate, and what patterns can be derived from individual movements in order to make population-level inferences are key areas when attempting to define basic population dynamics. These questions are of equal interest to biologists and managers, with many species assessments identifying improvements in the understanding of population-level movement as a key research need. We aimed to improve our understanding of population level movement for common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus by leveraging the largest satellite tagging dataset available for this species. Using a Bayesian approach specifically designed to address population-level questions with sparse telemetry data, we identified that A. vulpinus off the west coast of North America are partial migrators which conditionally migrate, based on a combination of fixed intrinsic states (size, sex) and variable extrinsic states (e.g. season, environment). Waters of the Southern California Bight were identified as an area where, seasonally, a large variety of sizes of A. vulpinus can be found. While smaller juveniles can be found throughout the year, larger sub-adults and adults often move out of the Bight during certain seasons (spring and winter). Knowledge of how A. vulpinus distribute along the coast, and that season, size, and to some extent sex, play important roles in where and what type of animals are likely to be found, are key pieces of information when attempting to accurately characterize basic biological parameters like age, growth, and reproduction, as well as understanding the effects of variable fishing pressures across the species' range.

AB  - A putative mechanism for maternal transfer of organic contaminants and total mercury was empirically demonstrated in a near-term pregnant female common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus). Contaminants were measured in the liver and muscle tissue of the mother and her four embryos, as well as the embryos' stomach contents. Concentrations of organic contaminants and mercury were found to be lower in the embryos' livers than in the mother's and were clearly measurable in the embryo stomach contents, which consisted of consumed ovulated eggs. Presence of high concentrations of organic contaminants and mercury in embryos, prior to any exogenous exposure, provides clear evidence of maternal offloading in this species. In addition, the detection of these chemicals in the yolky stomach contents provides a mechanism by which oophagous elasmobranch females offload contaminants onto their young.

AB  - Improved understanding of the seasonal distribution, habitat use, and fishery interactions of the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) in the western North Atlantic Ocean (WNA) is required for future management. We compiled and analyzed 3478 fishery-dependent capture records in the WNA between 1964 and 2019 to examine dynamics by sex and life stage (i.e., young of the year, juvenile, and adult). Sharks were captured over a broad geographic range from the Gulf of Mexico to the Grand Banks, primarily in continental shelf waters shallower than 200 m. Seasonal north-south movements along the east coasts of the United States and Canada were observed for all life stages and both sexes, with individuals generally occurring at more northerly latitudes in the summer and more southerly latitudes in the winter. Distinct areas of more frequent capture in fisheries were identified for all life stages throughout their range. Common thresher sharks were observed in waters with sea-surface temperatures of 4-31 degrees C, most commonly of 12-18 degrees C. The results of this study will help to identify essential fish habitat for each life stage of common thresher sharks along the U.S east coast and to develop management measures for the WNA population.

T2  - FISHERY BULLETIN

KW  - BLUE SHARK
AB  - Large pelagic sharks are caught incidentally in the swordfish and tuna fisheries of the Mediterranean Sea. In our study, twelve shark species were documented as bycatch over three years from 1998 to 2000. Blue shark (Prionace glauca) was the predominant species in all gears and areas examined. Shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus), and tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) were the next most abundant shark species found in more than half of the areas sampled. Catch composition varied both in the areas and gears investigated. Sharks represented 34.3% in weight of total catches sampled in the Alboran Sea and 0.9% in the Straits of Sicily. Higher shark catches were observed in the swordfish longline fishery, where a nominal CPUE value reached 3.8 sharks/1000 hooks in the Alboran Sea. Size distribution by fishing gear varied significantly. Albacore longline catches consisted mainly of juveniles, whereas subadult and adult specimens were more frequent in the swordfish longline and drift-net fishery. The percentage of sharks brought onboard alive was exceptionally high; only 5.1% of the specimens died. Few discards (seven blue shark) were recorded in the Greek longline fleet during onboard sampling in the Aegean Sea.

AB  - The common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) is the focus of a popular southern California recreational fishery that typically captures individuals by hooking them in the caudal fin This technique reduces the ability for forward locomotion and the capacity for ram ventilation This study assessed the post-capture survivorship of tail-hooked adult and sub-adult common thresher sharks using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and quantified physiological indicators of capture stress in the blood Survival of the acute effects of capture was determined from the depth and temperature records of 10-day PSAT deployments Survivorship estimates were based on 19 common thresher sharks [160-221 cm fork length (FL) similar to 67-151 kg] captured in southern California from 2007 to 2009 using recreational stand-up tackle (36 kg) Five mortalities were observed over the course of the study resulting in an overall post-release mortality estimate of 26% All mortalities occurred in large individuals (>= 180 cm FL) with fight times >= 85 min The archived depth and temperature data from surviving sharks resembled those of previous common thresher movement studies with a diel depth distribution predominantly within the uniformed temperature surface layer Capture Induced stress parameters measured from the blood of eight additional common thresher sharks that were not tagged revealed plasma lactate and hematocrit levels that were significantly elevated with increased fight time Similarly all thresher sharks showed heightened heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) values relative to those obtained from blood that was allowed to recover in vitro for 24 h Collectively our findings indicate that large tail-hooked common thresher sharks with prolonged fight times (>= 85 min) exhibit a heightened stress response which may contribute to an increased mortality rate These results suggest that for larger individuals the current caudal-based capture methods used in the California recreational fishery may not be suitable for an effective catch-and-release based conservation strategy (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - The common thresher, Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, are large pelagic shirk species frequently targeted by sport and commercial fisheries Being top marine predators, the common thresher and shortfin mako are susceptible to bioaccumulation of heavy elements in their tissues We investigated the levels of mercury (Hg) in the tissues of these sharks from the central and eastern North Pacific Ocean and how those levels reflect their feeding ecology For both species we found detectable levels of Hg in the white muscle but not in the liver, and no differences in Hg levels between the sexes, which suggests similar feeding patterns There was, however, a significant interspecific difference with the shortfin mako having considerably higher Hg levels than the common thresher This likely reflects the shortfin mako's opportunistic feeding on higher trophic level prey, such as jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas), relative to the common thresher which primarily targets smaller schooling fish We found strong linear relationships between body size and Hg level for both species with a significantly greater rate of increase for the shortfin mako which also may suggest a higher daily ration In all common thresher samples, Hg levels were well below the U S Food and Drug Administration's established action level of 1 0 mu g/g for commercial fish Nearly all shortfin mako muscle samples from sharks <= 150 cm fork length (FL) had Hg levels below 1 0 mu g/g, but all shortfin mako >150 cm FL had muscle Hg levels exceeding this level, with the largest sharks having nearly three times this level

AB  - Food web relationships in marine systems have traditionally been defined through stomach content analysis, but biochemical techniques have recently emerged to validate and broaden temporal diet patterns. Stable isotope analysis has become a practical tool for evaluating these relationships in aquatic systems; however, routine sampling of muscle tissue captures only part of the trophic information available from each animal. We compared delta N-15 and delta C-13 values among liver, muscle and cartilage in the blue shark Prionace glauca, shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus, and common thresher Alopias vulpinus from the northwest Atlantic to show how multiple-tissue sampling captured feeding relationships which would have been invisible to muscle tissue alone. Specifically, we demonstrated evidence of a cephalopod to bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix diet switch in the shortfin mako in spring, and found that the blue shark and common thresher have consistent diets throughout the year. We concluded that consistency observed among stable isotope values in multiple tissues implied that the fish were in steady-state with the isotope ratios of their diet and that multiple tissues should be used in trophic assessments of large pelagic fishes. Further experiments to quantify the turnover of stable isotopes in different tissues and species are needed to improve the accuracy of stable-isotope analyses.

AB  - Juvenile common thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) have been recently stranding along the California coastline. Using Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene along with necropsy, cytological, bacteriological, and histological techniques, we screened microbial communities and described lesions characterizing affected sharks with the purpose of identifying potential pathogen sources and pathologic processes. Histopathological assessment of moribund sharks revealed severe meningoencephalitis, as previously described in stranded salmon sharks (Lamna ditropis), along with inflammation of the inner ear and subcutaneous tissues surrounding the endolymphatic ducts. Furthermore, inflamed areas were characterized by the prevalence of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, suggesting this bacterium as a potential pathogen that gains access to the inner ear through the endolymphatic ducts, with subsequent spread into the brain. The absence or low abundance of this bacterium in the spiral valve in both healthy and infected sharks suggests that Carnobacterium is not a commensal member of their digestive communities and the spiral valve is unlikely to be the source of the pathogen. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggests that C. maltaromaticum strains isolated from diseased sharks have minimal genetic variation and differ from other strains originating from food or diseased teleosts. While a C. maltaromaticum-like organism has previously been associated with meningoencephalitis in salmon shark strandings, this is the first study to report common thresher shark strandings associated with C. maltaromaticum, involving the endolymphatic ducts as portals of entry to the brain.

AB  - We deployed jaws of the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) on the seafloor at similar to 1000 m depth off Monterey California for 8 months. The jaws disintegrated, with all the hyaline cartilage disappearing, leaving some fragments of tessellated cartilage and the teeth. Two different Osedax species, O. packardorum and O. talkovici were found to have bored into the roots of some of the teeth, and were using the dentin pulp, which is rich in collagen, as a food source. The enameloid crowns of the shark teeth and the tessellated cartilage showed no signs of Osedax activity. This is the first demonstration of Osedax exploiting a source of food that is not bone. This raises questions as to the original food source of Osedax 'bone worms'. Examination for the presence of Osedax in the skeletons and teeth of Mesozoic and possibly even Palaeozoic fossil sharks, bony fish and reptiles is warranted.

AB  - The common thresher shark Alopias vulpinus constitutes an important commercial fishery on the Pacific coasts of both the USA and Mexico. However, little is known about the juvenile phase of this species. This study used a combination of pop-up archival satellite tagging, tag-recapture, and fishery catch data to investigate the movement patterns, habitat preferences, ecology, and geographic distribution of juvenile common thresher sharks along the Pacific coast of the USA and Mexico. Juvenile threshers primarily utilized continental shelf waters, with a geographic range extending from Punta Eugenia in Baja California, Mexico (27.8 degrees N) north to Morro Bay, California (35.3 degrees N). Within this range, sharks were found at significantly lower latitudes in March and April. Satellite-tagged juvenile threshers exhibited diel patterns of vertical distribution, primarily inhabiting the upper 20 m of the water column by night, and significantly greater depths by day. In addition, juvenile threshers made frequent daytime dives to depths exceeding 50 m, with a maximum recorded dive depth of 192 m. Tracked sharks were most commonly associated with ambient water temperatures between 14 and 17 degrees C, and inhabited significantly warmer temperatures at night than during the day. No tidal or lunar influence on vertical distribution was found, and vertical habitat utilization did not increase concomitantly with shark size. This study is the first to document movements of juvenile threshers between US and Mexican waters, highlighting the need for bi-national management strategies for this shared fishery resource.

AB  - The common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) is a pelagic species with medially positioned red aerobic swimming musculature (RM) and regional RM endothermy. This study tested whether the contractile characteristics of the RM are functionally similar along the length of the body and assessed how the contractile properties of the common thresher shark compare with those of other sharks. Contractile properties of the RM were examined at 8, 16 and 24 A degrees C from anterior and posterior axial positions (0.4 and 0.6 fork length, respectively) using the work loop technique. Experiments were performed to determine whether the contractile properties of the RM are similar along the body of the common thresher shark and to document the effects of temperature on muscle power. Axial differences in contractile properties of RM were found to be small or absent. Isometric twitch kinetics of RM were similar to fivefold slower than those of white muscle, with RM twitch durations of about 1 s at 24 A degrees C and exceeding 5 s at 8 A degrees C, a Q(10) of nearly 2.5. Power increased approximately tenfold with the 16 A degrees C increase in temperature, while the cycle frequency for maximal power only increased from about 0.5-1.0 Hz over this temperature range. These data support the hypothesis that the RM is functionally similar along the body of the common thresher shark and corroborate previous findings from shark species both with and without medial RM. While twitch kinetics suggest the endothermic RM is not unusually temperature sensitive, measures of power suggest that the RM is not well suited to function at cool temperatures. The cycle frequency at which power is maximized appeared relatively insensitive to temperature in RM, which may reflect the relatively cooler temperature of the thresher RM compared to that observed in lamnid sharks as well as the relatively slow RM phenotype in these large fish.

AB  - Bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias superciliosus) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius) are large, pelagic fishes, which make long-duration, diurnal foraging dives from warm, surface waters (18-24 degrees C) to cold waters beneath the thermocline (5-10 degrees C). In bigeye thresher sharks, the subcutaneous position of the red, aerobic swimming muscles (RM) suggests that RM temperature mirrors ambient during dives (i.e., ectothermy). In swordfish, the RM is closer to the vertebrae and its associated with vascular counter-current heat exchangers that maintain RM temperature above ambient (i.e., RM endothermy). Here, we sought to determine how exposure to a wide range of ambient temperatures (8, 16, 24 degrees C) impacted peak power output and optimum cycle (i.e., tailbeat) frequency (0.25, 0.5, 1 Hz) in RM isolated from both species. Bigeye thresher shark RM did not produce substantial power at high cycle frequencies, even at high temperatures; but it did produce relatively high power at slow cycle frequencies regardless of temperature. Swordfish RM produced more power when operating at a combination of fast cycle frequencies and higher temperatures. This suggests that swordfish RM benefits considerably more from warming than bigeye thresher shark RM, while the RM of both species was able to produce power at cold temperatures and slow cycle frequencies. Despite different thermal strategies (i.e., ectothermy vs. RM endothermy), the ability of the RM to power sustained swimming during foraging-related search behaviors may contribute to the unique ability of these fishes to successfully exploit food resources in deep, cold water.

AB  - Fishes with internalized and endothermic red muscles (i.e. tunas and lamnid sharks) are known for a stiff-bodied form of undulatory swimming, based on unique muscle-tendon architecture that limits lateral undulation to the tail region even though the red muscle is shifted anteriorly. A strong convergence between lamnid sharks and tunas in these features suggests that thunniform swimming might be evolutionarily tied to this specialization of red muscle, but recent observations on the common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) do not support this view. Here, we review the fundamental features of the locomotor systems in lamnids and tunas, and present data on in vivo muscle function and swimming mechanics in thresher sharks. These results suggest that the presence of endothermic and internalized red muscles alone in a fish does not predict or constrain the swimming mode to be thunniform and, indeed, that the benefits of this type of muscle may vary greatly as a consequence of body size.

AB  - We have developed a set of tools that operate within an aquatic geographic information system to improve the accessibility, and usability of remote-sensed satellite and computer-modeled oceanographic data for marine science and ecosystem-based management. The tools form the Pelagic Habitat Analysis Module (PHAM), which can be applied as a modeling platform, an investigative aid in scientific research, or utilized as a decision support system for marine ecological management. Applications include fisheries, marine biology, physical and biological oceanography, and marine spatial management. The GIS provides a home for diverse data types and automated tools for downloading remote sensed and global circulation model data. Within the GIS environment, PHAM provides a framework for seamless interactive four-dimensional visualization, for matching between disparate data types, for flexible statistic or mechanistic model development, and for dynamic application of user developed models for habitat, density, and probability predictions. Here we describe PHAM in the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management, and present results from case study projects which guided development. In the first, an analysis of the purse seine fishery for tropical tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean revealed oceanographic drivers of the catch distribution and the influence of climate-driven circulation patterns on the location of fishing grounds. To support management of the Common Thresher Shark (Alopias vulpinus) in the California Current Ecosystem, a simple empirical habitat utilization model was developed and used to dynamically predict the seasonal range expansion of common thresher shark based on oceanographic conditions.

AB  - Studies on reproduction in sharks are important for their management, since the attainment of sexual maturity has a substantial impact on their distribution, behaviour and biology. However, reproductive biology of large oceanic sharks is poorly studied in the Indian seas. In this study, the size structure, sex and maturity of pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus), bigeye thresher (A. superciliosus), oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus), tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), longfin mako (I. paucus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) in the eastern Arabian Sea are described based on 1449 specimens collected from gillnet-cum-longline landings at the Cochin fisheries harbour during 2013 - 2014. Sex ratios of sampled specimens were biased to males in pelagic thresher, bigeye thresher, tiger shark and blue shark, while females dominated in the specimens of oceanic whitetip shark. Females matured at greater lengths than males in all species except oceanic whitetip shark. Lengths at maturity for males were in the range of 189.05 - 286.56 cm, whereas those of females were in the range of 187.74 - 310.69 cm. Litter sizes of both the thresher shark species were always two, while in oceanic whitetip shark, litter size was 3 - 9 and 22 - 51 in tiger shark. Seasonal reproduction was noticed in oceanic whitetip shark and tiger shark. Pregnant females were not found in the blue shark, shortfin and longfin makos sampled during the study period. Reproductive aspects of pelagic thresher, bigeye thresher, oceanic whitetip shark, tiger shark, shortfin mako, longfin mako and blue sharks in the eastern Arabian Sea are generally consistent with earlier reports from other regions of the world's oceans. These preliminary findings should be useful to identify suitable management measures for the above shark species.

AB  - The multispecific and highly dynamic nature of pelagic longline fisheries demands a holistic view that will likely benefit the development of effective management strategies. This study aims to provide an integrated perspective of the Portuguese longline fishery targeting swordfish Xiphias gladius and blue shark Prionace glauca in the Northeast Atlantic, regarding fishing dynamics, target species catches and associated bycatch. Data from 896 observed fishing sets (887,641 hooks) collected between 2015 and 2020 were used in a cluster analysis to group sets according to the target species. These sets were investigated for spatio-temporal patterns, and the rela-tionship between target species catches and environmental and operational characteristics were examined using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM). A total of 46,306 individuals from 54 species (30 fish, 11 sharks, 2 manta rays, 6 cetaceans, 2 sea turtles and 2 seabirds) were recorded. Swordfish and blue shark comprised over 88.3% of the total catch in numbers (33.6% and 54.7%, respectively). Overall, most of the fishing effort occurred west off mainland Portugal, congregated during autumn when vessels targeted mostly swordfish, and dispersed over the region during spring and summer, when vessels targeted mostly blue shark. The bycatch of sea turtles and a relatively higher diversity of bony fish species, yet low catch in terms of abundance, appeared more associated with sets identified as targeting swordfish. Recorded catch of tunas Thunnus spp. and pelagic sharks, such as the shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus and the porbeagle Lamna nasus, were more associated with blue shark sets. Bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus, thresher Alopias vulpinus, pelagic stingray Pteroplatytrygon violacea and lancetfish Alepisauros ferox were found equally associated with both targeted species. Management strategies for the region are discussed in light of these new findings.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have become key tools for describing and predicting species habitats. In the marine domain, environmental data used in modeling species distributions are often remotely sensed, and as such have limited capacity for interpreting the vertical structure of the water column, or are sampled in situ, offering minimal spatial and temporal coverage. Advances in ocean models have improved our capacity to explore subsurface ocean features, yet there has been limited integration of such features in SDMs. Using output from a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, we examine the effect of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDMs to describe the habitats of four pelagic predators in the California Current System (swordfish Xiphias gladius, blue sharks Prionace glauca, common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin mako sharks lsurus oxyrinchus). Species data were obtained from the California Drift Gillnet observer program (1997-2017). We used boosted regression trees to explore the incremental improvement enabled by dynamic subsurface variables that quantify the structure and stability of the water column: isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency. The inclusion of these dynamic subsurface variables significantly improved model explanatory power for most species. Model predictive performance also significantly improved, but only for species that had strong affiliations with dynamic variables (swordfish and shortfin mako sharks) rather than static variables (blue sharks and common thresher sharks). Geospatial predictions for all species showed the integration of isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency contributed value at the mesoscale level (< 100 km) and varied spatially throughout the study domain. These results highlight the utility of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDM development and support the continuing ecological use of biophysical output from ocean circulation models.

AB  - The diet of common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) from U.S. Pacific Coast waters was investigated by means of frequency of occurrence, gravimetric arid numerical methods, arid calculating the geometric index of importance (GII) of prey taxa taken from stomachs collected by fishery observers from the California-based drift gill net fishery. Sampling was done from 16 August 1998 to 24 January 1999, a time when the California Current was undergoing rapid change from El Nino to La Nina conditions. Of the 165 stomachs examined, 107 contained food representing a total of 20 taxa, revealing a broader trophic spectrum than previously reported for this species. Of the identifiable items, northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) vs,as the most important in the diet (GII = 48.2), followed by Pacific hake (Merluccius productus; GII = 31.2), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus; GII = 24.8), and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax. GII = 9.2). Of the invertebrates, squid (Teuthoidea, including Loligo opalescens; GII = 6.3), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes; GII = 6.6), vs-ere also important, especially numerically. For sharks collected north of 34degreesN latitude, hake was the most important identifiable species in the diet: northern anchovy was most important in the south, but was not identified in stomachs collected north of Point Conception.

AB  - We investigated the potential use of open coastal habitat over the continental shelf as a nursery area for the common thresher shark Alopias vulpinus. Seven juvenile threshers were tracked using acoustic telemetry to determine their movement patterns and nursery habitat in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Tracked sharks occupied waters over the continental shelf 87% of the time. These waters had an average (+/- SD) sea surface temperature of 18.8 +/- 1.6 degrees C and chlorophyll concentrations that were an order of magnitude higher than in adjacent waters offshore of the continental shelf. Tracked sharks had a mean rate of movement of 1.63 +/- 0.56 km h(-1) and some sharks exhibited high site fidelity. The vertical distribution of juvenile threshers was generally limited to the upper 20 m of the water, and most sharks showed did l depth distribution patterns, with daytime depths significantly greater than nighttime depths. An analysis of SCB commercial fishery observer data confirms that juvenile common threshers are most frequently captured over the continental shelf. This region appears to provide juvenile threshers with ample food resources and reduced predation risk relative to adult habitat, and partially satisfies more quantitative nursery area criteria recently established in the literature.

AB  - Off the US west coast, fishery development efforts have led to the recent recommendation for authorization of deep-set buoy gear (DSBG) and linked buoy gear (LBG), two commercial gear types for targeting swordfish at depth during the day. Because the new deep-set configurations interact with bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias superciliosus), a large pelagic species that is not typically retained for sale, this work has focused on documenting the fate of released catch. Bigeye thresher sharks (BETS) were captured and outfitted with pop-up satellite archival tags (Wildlife Computers sPATs and miniPATs) to assess movement trends and acute (30-d) post-release survival during exempted fishing trials authorized by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC). Post-release survivorship was based on 14 BETS (similar to 157-230 cm LF) caught on LBG between August 2016 and December 2019 following fight times ranging from 17-300 min. Thirteen BETS survived the acute effects of capture, and one immediate mortality was documented following heavy entanglement in the monofilament leader. BETS were resilient to the acute effects of handling stress following capture on LBG, with an observed post-release survival rate of 93 %. Surviving BETS exhibited consistent diurnal dive patterns with sharks remaining well below the thermocline during the daytime (mean = 386 +/- 62 m) and within the mixed layer at night (mean = 65 +/- 25 m). With the exception of one tag that reported within close proximity of the SCB tagging location, BETS exhibited extensive southward movements (mean = 1235 +/- 235 km) towards a potentially relevant migratory corridor for large pelagic sharks.

AB  - Following the discontinuation of commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) mixtures, a variety of alternative flame retardants (FRs) have been developed and employed. To understand the contamination status of these emerging FRs in marine fish and wildlife, we investigated their bioaccumulation in four shark species, including shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrhinchus; n = 26), porbeagle (Lamna nasus; n = 4), sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus; n = 6), and common thresher (Alopias vulpinus; n = 4), from coastal and offshore waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean. Median concentrations of emerging FRs, including dechlorane analogues (i.e., dechlorane plus, Dec-602, -603, and - 604), tetrabromo-o-chlorotoluene (TBCT), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), and hexabromobenzene (HBBZ), ranged from 1.4-7.4, 10.2-22.4, 1.0-16.7, and 4.1-17.7 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively. Although concentrations of emerging FRs were generally 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than those of legacy FRs (i.e., PBDEs, 312-800 ng/g lw and hexabromocyclododecane or HBCDD, 17.2-99.3 ng/g lw), they were detected in more than 80% of the shark livers. Analysis of available biological data indicated that fork length significantly correlated with the concentrations of sigma PBDEs, HBCDD, sigma Dechloranes or TBCT in shortfin mako livers. This indicates that longer term exposure likely results in elevated FR concentrations in sharks. Our findings suggest likely exposure of western North Atlantic fish and wildlife to several emerging FRs, including dechloranes, BTBPE, HBBZ, and TBCT. Additional studies are needed to better elucidate their potential risks to fish and wildlife as well as the variety of environmental and biological factors influencing these risks.

AB  - The common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) is a secondary target species of the California drift gillnet fishery (CA-DON) and supports a growing recreational fishery in California waters. This study used archival tags to examine the movement patterns and habitat preferences of common threshers of the size range captured in the CA-DON (> 120 cm fork length). Depth and temperature-logging archival tags were deployed on 57 subadult and adult common threshers in the Southern California Bight. Tags from five individuals (8.8%) were recovered, and 154 days of data were successfully obtained from four of these. By night, shark movements were primarily limited to waters above the thermocline, which ranged in depth from 15 to 20 m. Sharks were significantly deeper by day, and daytime vertical distribution consisted of two distinct modes: a 'shallow mode' (wherein sharks occupied only the upper 20 m of the water column) and a 'deep mode' (characterized by frequent vertical excursions below the thermocline). This modal switch is interpreted as relating to regional differences in abundance of surface-oriented prey and prey in deeper water. Maximum dive depth was 320 m, greatest dive duration was 712 min, minimum temperature experienced during a dive was 9.1 degrees C, and dive descent rate was significantly greater than ascent rate. Sharks inhabited waters corresponding to a sea surface temperature range of 16 to 21 degrees C. The nocturnal depth distribution of common threshers has implications for management of drift gillnet deployment depths in the CA-DON.

AB  - We report on 175 landings from 106 longline and 69 gillnet boats operating in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, July 1991 to July 1992. Information on the catch and biology of five shark species (Isurus oxyrinchus, Prionace glauca, Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus, and Sphyrna zygaena) is analyzed and contrasted with swordfish (Xiphias gladius) landings. A total of 51,205 fish were sampled, of which 40,198 were sharks, 9,990 swordfish, and the rest other bony fish. Spatial, temporal, and gear analyses were performed to show the importance of shark bycatch in longline and gillnet fisheries operating from the south of Spain. We present information on population structures of the shark species, along with hypotheses about shortfin mako movements as suggested by landing data.

AB  - Cryo-electron microscopy recently experienced great improvements in structure resolution due to direct electron detectors with improved contrast and fast read-out leading to single electron counting. High frames rates enabled dose fractionation, where a long exposure is broken into a movie, permitting specimen drift to be registered and corrected. The typical approach for image registration, with high shot noise and low contrast, is multi-reference (MR) cross-correlation. Here we present the software package Zorro, which provides robust drift correction for dose fractionation by use of an intensity-normalized cross-correlation and logistic noise model to weight each cross-correlation in the MR model and filter each cross-correlation optimally. Frames are reliably registered by Zorro with low dose and defocus. Methods to evaluate performance are presented, by use of independently-evaluated even- and odd frame stacks by trajectory comparison and Fourier ring correlation. Alignment of tiled sub-frames is also introduced, and demonstrated on an example dataset. Zorro source code is available at github.com/CINA/zorro. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diet of the bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus) was investigated by quantifying the stomach contents of sharks taken in the California-based drift gillnet fishery. Fishery observers collected stomachs of sharks ranging in size from 147 to 230 cm fork length during the 1998-99 and 2002-06 seasons in pelagic waters between the U.S.-Mexico border and Cape Mendocino, California. The frequency of prey items in stomachs by weight, number, and Occurrence was determined and used to calculate two indices of dietary preference: the geometric index of importance (GII) and index of relative importance (IRI). Of 26 stomachs examined, 23 contained food items representing 20 taxa, indicating a broad trophic spectrum. Overall, the two indices consistently ranked the relative importance of prey items. Of the 10 taxa of teleosts found in the diet, fish of the firmly barracudinas (Paralepididae) represented the most important prey item (GII = 52.8; %IRI = 45.98), followed by Pacific hake (Merluccius productus; GII = 38.4; %IRI = 24.23), Pacific saury (Cololabis saira; GII = 22.2; %IRI = 8.08), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus; GII = 17.3; %IRI = 3.92), and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax; GII = 16.0; %IRI = 3.93). Of the eight taxa of cephalopods, jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas; GII = 15.5; %IRI = 3.61) and Gonatus spp. squid (GII = 11.0; %IRI 0.63) were proportionately highest in ranking. The remaining two taxa were both crustaceans. Despite a sample size inadequate for characterizing the full breadth of the bigeye thresher diet, these data demonstrate that bigeye thresher sharks have a diverse diet and may feed opportunistically on locally and temporally available prey, including epipelagic, mesopelagic, epi-benthic, and deep-scattering-layer species. These data are consistent with fishery and electronic tracking data which demonstrate that the bigeye thresher shark is predominately a deep-water species, but spends time both within the deep-scattering and the mixed-surface layers.

AB  - Full stock assessment of sharks is usually hindered by a lack of long time-series catch and effort data. In these circumstances, demographic and per-recruit analyses may provide alternate approaches to describe population status because these methods can be applied to estimate biological reference points (BRPs) for shark stocks. However, the appropriate level of BRPs for sharks is difficult to determine, given the expected low reproductive rates. To determine which BRPs are most appropriate for the CITES-listed species-bigeye thresher shark, Alopias superciliosus, a stochastic demographic model with Monte Carlo simulations and per-recruit models were used to estimate BRPs in this study. The results indicated that conventional fishing mortality-based BRPs (F-BRPs) derived from per-recruit models may result in a clear population decline. Our analyses also demonstrated that the bigeye thresher population in the Northwest Pacific will stabilize only if demographic-based F-BRP is implemented. The F-BRP estimated based on the stochastic demographic model was 0.079-0.139 y(-1), which was equivalent to SPR = 50-70%. The findings strongly suggested that more conservative threshold F-BRPs should be implemented to ensure sustainable utilization of the bigeye thresher stock. The present study provides new and strategically important information on the population dynamics of the bigeye thresher in the Northwest Pacific, which can be used to help fishery managers to adopt more efficient management measures for this stock. It is also suggested that this approach can be applied to other shark species with limited catch and effort data.

AB  - The increasing consumption of shark products, along with the shark's fishing vulnerabilities, has led to the decrease in certain shark populations. In this study we used a DNA barcoding method to identify the species of shark landings at fishing ports, shark fin products in retail stores, and shark fins detained by Taiwan customs. In total we identified 23, 24, and 14 species from 231 fishing landings, 316 fin products, and 113 detained shark fins, respectively. All the three sample sources were dominated by Prionace glauca, which accounted for more than 30% of the collected samples. Over 60% of the species identified in the fin products also appeared in the port landings, suggesting the domestic-dominance of shark fin products in Taiwan. However, international trade also contributes a certain proportion of the fin product markets, as four species identified from the shark fin products are not found in Taiwan's waters, and some domestic-available species were also found in the customs-detained sample. In addition to the species identification, we also found geographical differentiation in the cox1 gene of the common thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus), the pelagic thresher shark (A. pelagicus), the smooth hammerhead shark (Sphyrna zygaena), and the scalloped hammerhead shark (S. lewini). This result might allow fishing authorities to more effectively trace the origins as well as enforce the management and conservation of these sharks.

AB  - By-catch is one of the main sources of anthropogenic mortality in marine species of conservation concern worldwide. Between 2006 and 2008, the Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Scienze del Mare (CoNISMa) coordinated a monitoring programme of cetacean by-catch in Italian pelagic trawlers, funded in compliance with European Regulation 812/2004. Sixteen independent observers monitored a total of 3141 hauls. The observation coverage ranged between 0.9 and 6.3% of the regional fishing effort. Almost all by-catch events were recorded in the northern Adriatic Sea. By-catch rates of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were 0.0006 and 0.0255 individuals per haul, respectively. Given the low number of observed deaths, reliable estimates of total mortality for these two species were not obtained. The annual number of by-caught turtles was 863 (CV = 0.15), with 99% released alive. A 'hotspot' for turtle captures was found off Goro (south Venice). The existence of lethal interactions makes it important to understand whether the scale of this mortality is sufficient to pose a threat at population level. Finally, annual by-catch estimates for rays and sharks were 5436 (CV = 0.08) and 5414 (CV = 0.15), respectively. Thintail threshers (Alopias vulpinus), piked dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and smooth-hounds (Mustelus mustelus), which are both commercial and vulnerable to overfishing, were taken in large numbers.

AB  - As upper-level predators, sharks are important for maintaining marine food web structure, but populations are threatened by fishery exploitation. Sustainable management of shark populations requires improved understanding of migration patterns and population demographics, which has traditionally been sought through physical and/or electronic tagging studies. The application of natural tags such as elemental variations in mineralized band pairs of elasmobranch vertebrae cartilage could also reveal endogenous and exogenous processes experienced by sharks throughout their life histories. Here, elemental profiles were characterized in vertebrae encompassing complete life histories (birth-to-death) of shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), common thresher (Alopias vulpinus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) of known tag and recapture locations in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. All sharks were injected with oxytetracycline at initial capture, released and subsequently recaptured, with individual liberty times ranging from 215 days to 6 years. Vertebral band pairs forming over the liberty intervals were verified by counting the number of band pairs deposited since the oxytetracycline band. Regular oscillations in vertebrae manganese (Mn) content corresponded well with the number of validated band pairs, suggesting that Mn variation could be used to age sharks. Increases in vertebrae barium concentration were correlated with times when individuals occupied areas with high coastal up welling indices, the timing and spatial intensity of which varied from year to year. Interspecific relationships were probably influenced by behavioural differences in horizontal and vertical habitat use, feeding habits and thermoregulatory physiology. These results indicate that vertebral sclerochronology has the potential to advance our knowledge of elasmobranch life history including age and growth estimation and environmental reconstruction.

AB  - Sharks are highly vulnerable species due to their biological characteristics. Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a useful method to assess the vulnerability of shark populations to prioritize management strategies. Given that molecular and genetic tools have played an important role in the conservation of vulnerable populations and species, the objective of this study was to evaluate the ecological risk of Prionace glauca, Isurus oxyrinchus, and Alopias vulpinus in the Mexican Pacific by incorporating genetic information into PSA. We hypothesized that the integration of genetic variables such as genetic structure and diversity (Fst, h, and pi), in a PSA will allow us to discriminate species with the same vulnerability index. The results of PSA-1 indicated that I. oxyrinchus, and A. vulpinus were at high ecological risk with identical vulnerability values (v = 2.2). Our results suggest that PSA with the combination of genetic attributes could be a useful tool for the application of conservation strategies or management policies, making easier the interpretation of results when the productivity or susceptibility attributes do not provide enough variation to prioritize between species or populations analyzed. Nevertheless, more studies that combine fishery and genetic information of commercially important sharks are needed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Satellite telemetry was used to study the movements and behaviour of ten blue sharks and one individual each of shortfin mako, thresher and bigeye thresher off eastern Australia. The tracks showed latitudinal movements of up to 1,900 km, but none of the sharks travelled away from the eastern Australian region. Tracking periods did not exceed 177 days. All species showed oscillatory dive behaviour between the surface layers to as deep as 560-1,000 m. Blue sharks spent 35-58% of their time in < 50 m depths and 10-16% of their time in > 300 m. Of these four species, the bigeye thresher spent the least time in the surface layers and the most time at > 300 m depth. All four species showed clear diel behaviour generally occupying shallower depths at night than during the day. Blue sharks were mainly in 17.5-20.0A degrees C water, while the thresher sharks showed a more bimodal temperature distribution.

AB  - Understanding habitat use of elasmobranchs in pelagic environments is complicated due to the mobility of these large animals and their ability to move great distances in a three-dimensional environment. The Gulf of Mexico is a region where many highly migratory pelagic shark species occur, while in close proximity to coastal, anthropogenic activity including recreational and commercial fisheries. This study provides summary information on the vertical habitat use for a single male scalloped hammerhead and a single male bigeye thresher that were each caught and tagged with an archiving satellite tag. The scalloped hammerhead occupied shallow depths (<100 m) over the continental shelf during the 90 d deployment. The bigeye thresher exhibited strong patterns of diel vertical migrations by occupying depths below the thermocline (>350 m) during the day, then occupying shallower depths (50-100 m) during the night. By providing summary information, this note urges future research to provide scientific information on pelagic, highly migratory species for management efforts in the Gulf of Mexico region.

AB  - The melanomacrophage aggregates or cells (MMC) are commonly used as biomarkers of exposure to pollution in fish, albeit their numbers and morphological characteristics can be influenced not only by environmental toxins but also by a range of physiological parameters and pathological conditions. Accordingly, before we can use MMC as biomarkers in any fish species, their normal, 'background' characteristics have to be established in apparently healthy fish. The knowledge of MMC in sharks is minimal. The aim of this study was to characterize MMC from 51 free-ranging, large pelagic sharks from the northwestern Atlantic, including shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrhinchus, thresher, Alopias vulpinus and blue shark, Prionacae glauca. The rationale of this study was twofold. First, because, sharks have life histories predisposing them to the accumulation of environmental toxins they constitute good sentinel species of the health of the global marine ecosystem. Second, because many shark populations are in decline or threatened by extinction, we need to expand our understanding of their health status in order to develop appropriate protective measures. All sharks were collected by sports fishing gear between June and August in 2007. Their health condition was assessed by necropsy, morphometrics, and by microscopic examination of gonads, livers, spleens and kidneys. Routine, haematoxylin and eosin and/or Pearl's reagent-stained paraffin embedded sections were studied by light microscopy. Our results provide the first data on the morphometric and morphological characteristics of MMC in viscera of apparently healthy free-ranging sharks from the northwestern Atlantic.

AB  - Pelagic longliners targeting swordfish and tunas in oceanic waters regularly capture sharks as bycatch, including currently protected species as the bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus. Fifteen bigeye threshers were tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) in 2012-2014 in the tropical northeast Atlantic, with successful transmissions received from 12 tags for a total of 907 tracking days. Marked diel vertical movements were recorded on all specimens, with most of the daytime spent in deeper colder water (mean depth = 353 m, SD = 73; mean temperature = 10.7 degrees C, SD = 1.8) and nighttime spent in warmer water closer to the surface (mean depth = 72 m, SD = 54; mean temperature = 21.9 degrees C, SD = 3.7). The operating depth of the pelagic longline gear was measured with Minilog Temperature and Depth Recorders (TDRs), and the overlap with habitat utilization was calculated. Overlap is taking place mainly during the night and is higher for juveniles. The results presented herein can be used as inputs for Ecological Risk Assessments for bigeye threshers captured in oceanic tuna fisheries, and serve as a basis for efficient management and conservation of this vulnerable shark species.

AB  - Elasmobranch species composition and spatiotemporal variability can often be characterized from landing surveys of local fisheries, with important management implications. In the present study, we describe the elasmobranch landing composition of 4 major artisanal fishing ports in northwestern Baja California, Mexico. Sampling was conducted opportunistically between 1995 and 2010 and included an effort of 684 fishing days. Species composition was gear-dependent and varied with the fishing area, with thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) and spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi) dominating the catches landed by coastal gill net fisheries, and blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and shortfm mako sharks (Isurus oxyrhinchus) dominating the catches landed by the offshore longline fishery. Size-structure analysis indicated that catches were composed primarily of juveniles for most species, although the catch of mature soupfin sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) increased in longline fisheries during the winter. The results indicate that minor regional differences in elasmobranch species composition occur along the Pacific coast of Baja California and arc most likely related to regional oceanographic or habitat differences. The results of this study may form the basis for future efforts to monitor species composition changes over time, to more completely assess elasmobranch populations.

AB  - Sharks, as top order predators, provide a guidance on how contaminants such as mercury bioaccumulate in marine en-vironments. This study assessed the bioaccumulation of mercury (total mercury, THg) in the muscle, liver, red blood cells (RBC), and plasma of pelagic and bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus and A. superciliosus) from eastern trop-ical Pacific. Additionally, the concentration of methylmercury (MeHg) in muscle was also determined to assess risks for human consumption. For both species, muscle THg concentrations (4.05 +/- 2.15 and 4.12 +/- 1.84 mu g g-1 dry weight for pelagic and bigeye thresher shark) were higher than that in other tissues. THg concentrations for all tissues were significantly correlated with precaudal length, with higher accumulation rates after maturity in pelagic than bigeye thresher sharks, suggesting an associated dietary shift at maturation. Correlations among tissues in both species sug-gested similar transportation and distribution patterns in internal tissues. The 813C values in muscle, RBC and plasma suggested that habitat shifts influenced Hg accumulation, whereas trophic position, estimated by 815N values, had lim-ited effects on patterns of Hg bioaccumulation. Diet shifts towards prey more cephalopods that content higher Hg than small fishes (large fishes: 1.77 mu g g-1; cephalopods: 0.66 mu g g-1 and small fishes 0.48 mu g g-1 , dry weight) increased Hg accumulation rates in adult pelagic thresher sharks. Concentrations of MeHg in the muscle of both thresher shark (3.42 +/- 1.68 mu g g-1 in A. pelagicus and 3.78 +/- 2.13 mu g g-1 in A. superciliosus) exceeded the recommended levels for human consumption. This research provides insight into the factors influencing mercury bioaccumulation in thresher sharks, which are essential for the management and conservation of these species.

TI  - Decreases in Shark Catches and Mortality in the Hawaii-Based Longline Fishery as Documented by Fishery Observers
T2  - MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES
LA  - English
AB  - This article summarizes catch data for sharks collected by fishery observers during two periods (1995-2000 and 2004-2006) in the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery, which targets swordfish Xiphias gladius in the shallow-set sector and bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus in the deep-set sector. The blue shark Prionace glauca was the predominant shark species caught throughout the study period (84.5% of all sharks). Five other species (bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus, oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus, shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus, silky shark C. falciformis, and crocodile shark Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) were relatively common (1.0-4.1%). Two major developments affected shark catches in this fishery during the study period. The first was the prohibition in 2000 of shark finning under most circumstances. The second development was that management measures were taken in 2000 and 2001 to protect sea turtles (leatherback sea turtles Dermochelys coriacea and loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta) and these measures included a closure of the shallow-set (swordfish-targeting) sector for more than 3 years. The closure caused decreases in shark catches because the shallow-set sector was typically characterized by high catch rates. The shallow-set sector was reopened in 2004. Comparisons of nominal catch per unit effort (number of sharks/1,000 hooks) revealed significant differences in catch rates between the two fishery sectors and the two periods. Blue shark and shortfin mako catch rates were significantly greater in the shallow-set sector than in the deep-set sector of the fishery, whereas the opposite was true for the deeper-dwelling bigeye threshers and crocodile sharks. Catch rates for the blue shark, oceanic whitetip shark, bigeye thresher, and crocodile shark were significantly lower in 2004-2006 than in 1995-2000. For the blue shark in particular, the combination of reduced catch rates, the finning ban, and an apparent capacity to resist the stress of capture on longline gear resulted in low (4%-5.7%) minimum mortality estimates. Therefore, we conclude that the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery has made substantial progress in reducing shark mortality.

AB  - A Bayesian population modelling tool integrating separable virtual population analysis, per-recruit models and age-structured demographic analysis was developed for the bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus (Lowe) population in an area subset of the western North Pacific. The mortality rates for years 1989-2016 were estimated, various biological reference points and associated risks of decline were also estimated, and alternative harvest strategies for the stock were evaluated. Estimates of the posterior mean of fishing mortality for bigeye thresher shark suggest fishing pressure has been high in recent years (2011-2016). The estimated population growth rate (lambda) (without fishing) obtained from age-structured demographic model was relatively low (lambda = 1.01 per year; 95% confidence intervals of 1.00 and 1.03 per year). Risk analyses revealed that only low levels of fishing pressure (10% of the current fishing pressure) over a wide range of ages could maintain a relatively low risk of population decline for bigeye threshers. Sensitivity testing indicated that the model is robust to prior specification. The developed framework could be used as an assessment tool to evaluate the risk of decline for other widely distributed pelagic shark species where insufficient catch and effort data are available.

AB  - Tunas (family Scombridae) and sharks in the family Lamnidae are highly convergent for features commonly related to efficient and high-performance (i.e. sustained, aerobic) swimming. High-performance swimming by fishes requires adaptations augmenting the delivery, transfer and utilization of O-2 by the red myotomal muscle (RM), which powers continuous swimming. Tuna swimming performance is enhanced by a unique anterior and centrally positioned RM (i.e. closer to the vertebral column) and by structural features (relatively small fiber diameter, high capillary density and greater myoglobin concentration) increasing O-2 flux from RM capillaries to the mitochondria. A study of the structural and biochemical features of the mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) RM was undertaken to enable performance-capacity comparisons of tuna and lamnid RM. Similar to tunas, mako RM is positioned centrally and more anterior in the body. Another lamnid, the salmon shark (Lamna ditropis), also has this RM distribution, as does the closely related common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus; family Alopiidae). However, in both the leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata) and the blue shark (Prionace glauca), RM occupies the position where it is typically found in most fishes; more posterior and along the lateral edge of the body. Comparisons among sharks in this study revealed no differences in the total RM quantity (approximately 2-3% of body mass) and, irrespective of position within the body, RM scaling is isometric in all species. Sharks thus have less RM than do tunas (4-13% of body mass). Relative to published data on other shark species, mako RM appears to have a higher capillary density, a greater capillary-to-fiber ratio and a higher myoglobin concentration. However, mako RM fiber size does not differ from that reported for other shark species and the total volume of mitochondria in mako RM is similar to that reported for other sharks and for tunas. Lamnid RM properties thus suggest a higher O-2 flux capacity than in other sharks; however, lamnid RM aerobic capacity appears to be less than that of tuna RM.

AB  - This study highlighted the occurrence of a pelagic longline fishery targeting albacore in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea off Egypt. Species selectivity of the fishing method was assessed. Catch per unit effort "CPUE", size frequency and length-weight relationship were estimated for the target species. This fishing method was found to be highly selective for albacore, where its catch represented about 93.5% of the total landed catch. The major by-catch species were swordfish Xiphias gladius (2.5%) and the little tunny Euthynnus alletteratus (2.4%). Skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, Bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus, and oilfish Ruvettus pretiosus represented collectively, 1.5% of the total landed catch. The fork length of albacore ranged from 54 to 138 cm, with an average of 79.1 +/- 7.2 cm. Total weight ranged from 4 t 40 kg with an average of 8.8 +/- 7.2 kg. The length-weight relationship was determined to be W = 5.26 x 10(-5) L-2.75 (W in kg, L in cm). The CPUE for albacore ranged from 7 to 22 fish / 1000 hooks for the different fishing trips, with an average CPUE of 12 fish/1000 hooks (SE +/- 4.4).

Among Siphonostomatoida parasitic on fish, G. pyriformis is the first representative known to have five, and not three or fewer naupliar stages in its life cycle. The infective copepodid bears a resemblance to the encysted copepodid 1 of Amaterasia amanoiwatoi Izawa, 2008.

AB  - The bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus) is a large pelagic predator routinely caught in a new deep-set fishery off California. Deep-set buoy gear (DSBG) was recently developed to selectively target swordfish (Xiphias gloats) at depth during the daytime and is currently being trialed by a limited fleet of vessels operating under an exempted fishing permit (EFP) issued through the National Marine Fishery Service (NMFS) and Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC). Although marketable, bigeye thresher sharks (BETS) are often released or discarded to conserve limited hold space for more valuable catch. This study outfitted BETS with pop-up satellite archival transmitters (PSATs) programmed for 30-day deployments to evaluate acute post-release survival in the DSBG fishery and begin to understand depth and temperature distribution for this poorly known species. Fourteen BETS (43-93 kg) were tagged from 2016 to 2018 with PSATs (Wildlife Computers sPATs and MiniPATs) following fight times that ranged from 15 to 171 min. Out of the 14 deployments, twelve individuals survived the acute effects of capture, one BETS died shortly after release and one individual was preyed upon 6 h after release. Given the lack of information surrounding the predation induced mortality, two survivorship estimates are provided, one that includes the event as a mortality resultant of the capture event (86% survivorship) and one that excludes the event from the analysis (92% survivorship). All surviving BETS exhibited consistent diurnal dive patterns in which the sharks remained below the thermocline during the day and within the mixed layer at night. Mean daytime depths ranged from 250 to 439 m, while mean nighttime depths ranged from 20 to 106 m. Daytime temperatures at depth ranged from 6 to 10 degrees C with the lowest temperature value (6.0 degrees C) recorded on the deepest dive (548m). For all BETS, maximum night temperatures averaged from 22.5 to 25.1 degrees C. Two tagged individuals remained proximal to the study area (< 150 km) with others moving up to > 1300 km from the tagging site (mean = 1009 +/- 455 km). Mean daily rates of horizontal movement ranged from 3.4 to 41.6 km day(-1). The most common movement trend entailed BETS moving in a southerly direction towards a series of offshore seamounts along southern Baja California, Mexico (22 degrees-26 degrees N and 114 degrees-426 degrees W), a purported offshore corridor for other large pelagic sharks of the eastern Pacific.

AB  - Illegal, large-scale driftnets are still used in several Mediterranean areas. According to international official sources, Morocco harbors the bulk of this fleet in the Mediterranean. To ascertain its biodiversity impact, 369 fishing operations (worth 4140 km of driftnets set) made by the driftnet fleet targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) based in Al Hoceima (Alboran Sea) were monitored between December 2002 and September 2003. Parallel surveys were made in the main Mediterranean ports and in that of Tangiers, in the Gibraltar Straits, to estimate the total fishing effort. Results showed an active driftnet fleet conservatively estimated at 177 units. Estimated average net length ranges from 6.5 to 7.1 km, depending on the port, though actual figures are suspected to be much higher (12-14 km). Most boats perform driftnet fishing all year round, resulting in very high annual effort levels. A total of 237 dolphins (short-beaked common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, and striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba), 498 blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 542 shortfin makos (Isurus oxyrinchus) and 464 thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) were killed by the boats monitored during the sampling period, during the peak of the swordfish fishery, along with 2990 swordfish. Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) was also caught (46 individuals). Estimates for a 12-month period by the whole driftnet fleet yielded 3110-4184 dolphins (both species) and 20,262-25,610 pelagic sharks distributed in roughly equal proportions for P. glauca, I. oxyrinchus and A. vulpinus, in the Alboran Sea alone; further 11,589-15,127 dolphins and 62,393-92,601 sharks would be killed annually around the Straits of Gibraltar. Dolphins suffer from annual take rates exceeding 10% of their population sizes in the Alboran Sea; this unsustainable impact is particularly worrying for D. delphis, because its last remnant healthy population in the Mediterranean occurs in this area. Average catch rate for swordfish, the main target species, amounted to only 0.8 individuals/km net set. Pelagic sharks are actively targeted by a part of the fleet. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The bigeye thresher (Alopias superciliosus) is a pelagic shark captured as bycatch in pelagic long-line fisheries. Important information on its biology is still missing, especially from the Atlantic Ocean. In all, 546 vertebrae collected by fishery observers between 2007 and 2009 were used to estimate age and growth parameters for this species in the Atlantic Ocean. The size composition was 102-265 cm fork length (FL) for females and 94-260 cm FL for males. The estimated ages ranged from 0 to 25 years for both sexes. From the 5 growth models used, the 3-parameter von Bertalanffy growth model, reparameterized to estimate length at birth (L-0), produced the best results. The estimated parameters were asymptotic maximum length (L-inf)=284 cm FL, growth coefficient (k)=0.06/year, and L-0=109 cm FL for females and L-inf=246 cm FL, k=0.09/year, and L-0=108 cm FL for males. Although differences between hemispheres indicate slower growth rates in the South Atlantic Ocean, these differences may also have been caused by the lower sample size and larger specimen sizes for the Southern Hemisphere. The estimated growth coefficients are among the lowest found for the Alopiidae, highlighting the bigeye thresher's slow growth and consequent low resilience to fishing pressure.

AB  - The bigeye thresher shark Alopias supeciliosus is a large epipelagic and mesopelagic species, and it has a wide distribution in the Atlantic. However, its record in the Gulf of Mexico is sporadic. A single adult female of A. superciliosus, measuring 360 cm total length and about weight 165 kg, was caught by artisanal fishers in Salinas Roca Partida, Veracruz, Mexico, on July 14, 2020. This study reports the first occurrence of this species in the southwestern of the Gulf of Mexico, which extends its geographical distribution in Mexico.

AB  - This research paper proposes a reading of Ecuatorian writer Monica Ojeda's short story "Slasher". The value of sound is assumed as an essential constituent of the identity structure of gothic characters, through semiotic approaches to literature and audiovisual language; as well as a producer element of meaning that becomes a terror-generating device in communion with a visual organization. In this order of ideas, the argumentation evidences the importance of topoi in the gothic genre, and its relationship with the noise scene, manifestation of sound art and experimentation field, in which radical manipulation of the means of production and acoustic composition evidences its merit to probe the fears of human nature.

AB  - The bigeye thresher (Alopias supercilious) is occasionally caught as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish. Still, it is one of the least known and studied of all pelagic sharks, which hinders assessment of the status of its populations. As part of an ongoing cooperative program for fisheries and biological data collection, information collected by fishery observers and through scientific projects from several nations that undertake fishing activities in the Atlantic (Japan, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan, Uruguay and US) was compiled and analyzed. Datasets include information on location, size, sex and, in some cases, maturity stage. A total of 5590 bigeye thresher records collected between 1992 and 2013 were compiled, with sizes ranging from 70 to 305 cm fork length (FL). Considerable variability was observed in size, with tropical regions recording a smaller mean size compared to other regions. The distribution of juvenile and adult specimens also showed considerable variability, and the sex ratios varied between regions and size classes. Median sizes at maturity were estimated at 208.6 cm FL for females and 159.2 cm FL for males. Pregnant females were recorded in the tropical northeast and southwest Atlantic, with these regions possibly serving as nursery areas. The biological and distributional patterns presented in this study provide a better understanding of different aspects of this species in the Atlantic, which can help managers adopt more informed and efficient conservation measures.

AB  - Elasmobranchs are rapidly declining due to overfishing and bycatch, underlining the need for immediate protection. Critical baseline information on the diversity of targeted species is, however, often missing. Peru is a major country for shark fishery, an activity that has been under-regulated and poorly monitored, aggravated by the superficial taxonomic identifications at landing points across the country. Furthermore, most of the species landed by the shark fishery in Peru are listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List. To assess the diversity of shark species targeted by fisheries in Peru we analyzed the variation of the cytochrome oxidase I (cox1) region of the mitochondrial DNA from 118 samples collected between 2004 and 2009, from six landing points. Our analysis revealed unambiguously that the 16 shark species classified by fishermen using meristic characters corresponded only to nine species. While some commonly landed species (e.g. Prionace glauca) were consistently correctly identified, for others species multiple inconsistent names were applied (e.g. Galeorhinus galeus). Our molecular characterization further allowed the identification of specimens with non-informative common names (i.e. "tiburon" = shark). In most cases the unknown specimens were Isurus oxyrinchus and P. glauca. Interestingly, all samples labeled as common thresher (Alopias vulpinus) were identified as pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus). Finally, one sample was equivocally identified as a dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and as a galapagos shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis) reinforcing the genetic similarity reported for these species. We generated a character-based identification library containing 26 of the 31 commercially important sharks landed in Peru and tested its performance as a species diagnostic. The library correctly identified 25 out of 28 barcodes tested, outperforming the distance-based approach. This is the first study sequencing barcodes of marine species in Peru and generated a genetic reference library of targeted shark species. We suggest that the molecular tools used are a quick and effective complement for the monitoring of the fishery of threatened shark species. A combined effort to obtain these data, by countries in the east Pacific region with an on-going shark fishery, would provide with the essential guiding information to promote the implementation of effective sustainable management plans.

AB  - Thermodynamic, circular dichroism (CD), and activity measurements have been used to characterize the different conformational states and the effects of NaCl concentrations (0.0-3.0 M) on thermal unfolding of ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT) from Alopias vulpinus. Furthermore conformational changes in whole enzyme structure have been monitored by titration of SH-groups. OCT unfolding process follows an irreversible two-state mechanism with a first-order kinetic of denaturation, without breaking-point. NaCl shows very little stabilization effects at low concentration and its action become very important over 1.5 M concentration. The presence of 3.0 M NaCl completely avoids OCT unfolding at 60,64 and 66 degrees C. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are strongly influenced by the presence of high NaCl concentration. Our experiments showed that NaCl stabilization process involved changes in preferential binding, in electrostatic and van der Waals interactions and exposure of buried site and SH-groups. During thermal denaturation, UV-vis and CD spectroscopy show that high salts concentration preserves OCT activity, avoiding exposure of hydrophobic site and destruction of secondary and tertiary structure elements.

AB  - Thresher sharks (family Alopiidae) are an evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species group. Indonesia is the world's largest shark fishing nation, and a global priority for reducing the capture of threatened shark species. Kutaradja port is one of Indonesia's largest fishing ports, located in the capital of Aceh Province, Banda Aceh, Western Indonesia. Kutaradja is a large oceanic port serving a variety of fisheries, from small scale to industrial fleets. One of the main fisheries operating from Kutaradja port is an industrial purse seine fleet targeting valuable pelagic fish, particularly tuna. Pelagic sharks such as threshers are vulnerable to capture in these fisheries, due to their co-occurrence with stocks of valuable pelagic species. Here we describe the volume and composition of shark catch in Kutaradja's purse seine fleet, based on daily landing monitoring conducted in January 2017 to May 2019. Our results show that the dominant species caught are thresher sharks (Alopiidae), which make up 51% of all shark landings. A total of 627 thresher sharks were landed during the monitoring period, consisting of 558 individuals of pelagic threshers shark (Alopias pelagicus) and 69 individuals of bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus). The catch is dominated by mature females, which could be particularly detrimental to the reproductive capacity of the population. Fishers in purse seine vessels often catch these threshers with hand-lines, which are used as a secondary gear while the main fishing gear is soaking. Based on these findings, we proposed recommendations for reducing thresher shark fishing mortality, including restricting the use of secondary fishing gears and releasing incidentally captured sharks.

AB  - This study presents the results based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) and incidental catch ratios of surveys on the Turkish swordfish longliners during the fishing seasons between 2008 and 2013. A total of 50 surveying operations were carried out, including 45 in Fethiye, 5 in Ozdere in the southern Aegean coasts along the eastern Mediterranean Sea. A total of 217 (4061 kg) swordfish were obtained during 50 operations. The mean CPUEs for swordfish by number and weight were computed as 10.8 +/- 1.59 specimens and 179.6 +/- 21.48 kg per 1000 hooks, respectively. Although, there was no significant differences among means of CPUEs by number of swordfish (P>0.05), the CPUEs by weight of swordfish were significantly different among years (P<0.05). A total of 14 species, belonging to 12 families (276 specimens; 5535 kg) were caught. The target swordfish had the highest ratio both in number (78.6%) and in biomass (73.3%), followed by Mobula mobular, Alopias vulpinus, Prionace glauca, Isurus oxyrinchus, Ruvettus pretiosus, Cotyphaena hippurus, Thunnus alalunga by weight, respectively. Biomass and number ratios of the non-target species to the target swordfish were 1:0.27 and 1:0.36, respectively. A total of two specimens of which P. glauca (10 kg) and M. mobular (300 kg) were released lively and the others were retained due to commercial value. A significant difference was not found between weight of by-catch species and weight of the swordfish according to years (P>0.05).

TI  - Estimates of marine mammal, turtle, and seabird mortality for two California gillnet fisheries: 1990-1995
T2  - FISHERY BULLETIN
LA  - English
AB  - Incidental kills of marine mammals, turtles, and seabirds are estimated for the California drift gillnet fishery for broadbill swordfish, Xiphias gladius, common thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, and the set gillnet fishery for California halibut, Paralichthys californicus, and Pacific angel shark, Squatina californica, for the period July 1990 through December 1995. Estimates were based on observations made by National Marine Fisheries Service observers placed aboard commercial fishing vessels. Yearly observer coverage varied between 4% and 18% of estimated total effort. Total fishing effort-days per California Department of Fish and Game fishing block was used as the measure of effort for the drift and set gillnet fisheries. Incidental kill was estimated from observed data and estimates of total effort by using mean-per-unit and ratio estimators. Additional bycatch data collected by NMFS observers were used to derive kill estimates of marine turtles and seabirds.
   In the drift gillnet fishery, seven out of 387 mammals observed entangled were released alive. In the set gillnet fishery, five out of 1,263 mammals observed entangled were released alive. Estimates of incidental kill are presented along with estimates of entanglement for species that were observed to be released alive. For the period under consideration, the estimated mortality for the drift gillnet fishery was over 450 marine mammals each year. A total of 20 turtles and 3 seabirds were observed entangled during the entire period. The most frequently en tangled species in this fishery were common dolphins, Delphinus spp., and northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris. Estimated cetacean mortality in the driftnet fishery decreased from 650 in 1991 to 417 in 1995; pinniped mortality decreased from 173 in 1991 to 116 in 1995. Estimated cetacean mortality in the set gillnet fishery ranged from a high of 38 in 1991 to a low 14 in 1993; pinniped mortality rose to a high of 4,777 in 1992 and then decreased to 1,016 in 1995. We postulate that there has been a decline in the number of pinnipeds and cetaceans in the setnet fishery owing to area closure. No similar proposal can be made for the driftnet fishery. The most frequently entangled mammals in the setnet fishery were California sea lions, Zalophus californianus, and harbor seals, Phoca vitulina. Six turtles and 1,018 seabirds were estimated entangled in this fishery during the NMFS Observer Program from July 1990 to December 1995.

AB  - Inaccurate age estimates can have severe consequences in the management of elasmobranchs. Numerous studies in shark age validation have demonstrated a disconnect between band pair counts and age, resulting in age underestimation, particularly in older individuals. To investigate the relationship between band pairs, vertebral shape and growth, we quantified intracolumn differences in centrum morphology (size and structure) and band pair counts in seven shark species: Squatina dumeril, Carcharodon carcharias, Lamna nasus, Isurus oxyrinchus, Alopias vulpinus, Prionace glauca and Carcharhinus obscurus. In all species examined, band pair deposition was closely related to body girth and the structural properties of the cartilaginous skeleton, relative to maximum size, and body type. These results have strong implications for accurately assessing age for fisheries management of these species.

AB  - Large-sized pelagic sharks and teleost fish are vulnerable to overexploitation by professional fisheries. To date, however, little is known about the species caught through recreational fishing. The aim of this study is to assess the catch of pelagic sharks and teleost fish in the Mediterranean Sea by recreational fishermen through an analysis of publicly available videos posted on social media. Results revealed that several vulnerable species are caught by offshore recreational fishermen: blue shark (Prionace glauca), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus), sixgill shark (Hexanchus griseus), swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and Mediterranean spearfish (Tetrapturus belone). The most commonly caught species are blue shark and swordfish, the majority of which are juvenile and released back to sea. This paper proposes new measures for handling practices in order to protect these species.

AB  - Observations on field-scale trials in traits seed yield, oil content and oil yield by winter hybrid oilseed rape (Pronto) and conventional varieties (Eurol, Falcon, Bristol, Capitol, Lirajet, Olymp, Slapska Stela, Zorro) in four year period (1995/1996 to 1998/1999) have been evaluated. Hybrid variety Pronto achieved every year not only the best seed yield in comparison to the mean of conventional varieties, but also better yields than the best of conventional ones. Oil content was however below 100% each year and twice even lower than the lowest of conventional varieties (1997/1998 Capitol, 1998/1999 Lirajet), differences were however very small. In spite of subnormal oil content, Pronto (owing to high seed yield) achieved also the high oil yield. Differences to the best conventional varieties were however not so significant as in seed yield. In one of these observed years Pronto has been exceeded by conventional variety (1997/1998: Pronto 107.4%, Bristol 107.6%).

AB  - Aminocyclopyrachlor (AMCP) is labeled for use on zoysiagrass, but some injury has been observed. Differential zoysiagrass cultivar response to herbicide treatment has been previously reported. This greenhouse study evaluated the response of 'BK-7', 'Cavalier', 'Emerald', 'Empire', 'Meyer', and 'Zorro' zoysiagrass to 0, 0.005, 0.02, 0.11, 0.52, and 2.4, 11 kg ai ha(-1), AMCP. Visual estimation of percent necrosis and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) analysis were conducted. Based on rating dates and data types three tolerance groups were established: Cavalier, Meyer, and Zorro are the most tolerant; Emerald and Empire are intermediate; and BK-7 is the least tolerant to AMCP. All zoysiagrass cultivars had sufficient tolerance at the labeled rate. Visual and NDVI analyses were highly correlated; however, NDVI data were subject to greater standard error and pseudo R-2 values.

AB  - The Mexican elasmobranch fishery ranks among the most important in the world, but details associated with fishing effort and species composition are generally unavailable, particularly for the extensive artisanal fishery. Seasonal Surveys were conducted during 1998-1999 in the state of Baja California to determine the extent and activities of the artisanal elasmobranch fishery along its Gulf of California coast. Artisanal fishermen were highly opportunistic, and temporally switched targets depending oil the local abundance of teleost, invertebrate, and elasmobranch fisheries resources. At least 17 species of shark, 13 species of ray, and 2 species of skate were identified among the 4495 specimens observed. Small, coastal sharks and rays were typically landed with bottom set gillnets during all Surveyed seasons (spring-autumn) and large sharks were targeted with surface set (drift) gillnets during summer and autumn. Sharks and rays contributed similarly to elasmobranch landings, comprising 50.9% and 48.3%, respectively, of the total recorded catch. Overall landings were dominated by mustelid sharks (Mustelus henlei, Mustelus spp.) and the shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), with Alopias pelagicus, Gymnura spp., Heterodontus mexicanus, Mobula munkiana, Myliobatis californica, and Squatina californica also representing important components of the landings. Alopias vulpinus had previously been unreported for the Gulf of California and a new maximum size record was documented for Myliobatis longirostris. Catch rates (mean elasmobranchs/vessel/trip +/- standard error) were lowest during autumn (17.4 +/- 3.9) and highest in spring (35.3 +/- 14.1). Adult, commonly gravid, A. pelagicus, Carcharhinus falciformis, and R. productus females comprised a disproportionately greater component of the landings than did their male counterparts. Given the decades of largely unrestricted exploitation of elasmobranchs in Mexican waters, population declines and shifts in size structure are likely to have occurred among those species with the lowest fecundity and latest ages at maturity.

AB  - Basic ecological information is of critical importance for the development of conservation strategies for endangered amphibian species. The Gannoruwa Shrub Frog (Pseudophilautus zorro) is an endangered endemic and a geographically restricted frog found in mid elevations of the central highlands of Sri Lanka whose ecology is little known. We assessed: (1) aspects of microhabitat associations; (2) the realized niche to identify potential areas of occupancy using Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM); and (3) estimated the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and Area of Occupancy (AOO) of P. zorro with new locality data and predicted data. The results indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between leaf litter thickness and number of individuals of P. zorro in quadrats and a significant relationship between percentage of canopy cover and number of individuals of P. zorro in quadrats. Pseudophilautus zorro is more abundant in broad-leaf forests than pine forests. ENM predicted highly suitable areas (suitability > 80%) in the Kandy, Matale, and Kegalle districts in Sri Lanka. The EOO and AOO of P. zorro with new occurrence data was 558 km(2) and 9 km(2), and with predicted data, 2,374 km(2) and 612 km(2) respectively, indicating an increase in EOO and AOO. The data on microhabitat preferences and predicted habitats will be invaluable to formulate in-situ and ex-situ conservation strategies for this species.

AB  - Between August 1995 and August 1997 long line fishing techniques and a bathythermograph were used to correlate some physical variables with the spatial distribution of four shark species in 26 fishing cruises off the Nicaraguan Pacific Coast. They were the thresher (Alopias vulpinus), blue (Prionace glaucea), gray (Carcharhinus falciformis) and hammer (Sphyra lewini). All species concentrated in the southeastern Nicaraguan Pacific, at the seasonal upwelling area of Papagayo Gulf. The range of sea surface temperatures in which the sharks were captured was 25-28 degreesC. We could clearly associate this physical parameter with shark availability. The vertical distribution of the captured sharks suggests that they occupy termocline levels above the 15 degreesC isotherm. Although these species are oceanic, the blue shark was captured in ocean waters over the 1800m isobar, while the grey and thresher sharks where close to the continental shelf. Body length in decreasing order are: thresher(210-290 cm, SN = 21), blue (60-240 cm, SN = 13) and gray (80-200 cm, SN = 17).

AB  - The diet of thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) during a cool-water oceanographic regime, July 1999 through May 2000, was compared to the diet during the previous warm-water/transitional period, August 1998 through January 1999. Stomach samples were collected from the U.S. Pacific Coast drift and set gill net fisheries. Of the samples examined from the cool-water period, only 8 prey taxa were found, revealing a narrower trophic spectrum than found during the previous warm-water/transitional period, when 20 prey taxa were identified. As in the warm-water/transitional period, northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) was the most important overall prey, even more dominant than in the previous period. Additionally, market squid (Loligo opalescens) was second in importance and dramatically more prevalent in the cool-water period than in the warm-water/transitional period. Other important diet items in the cool-water period, in descending order of importance, were "unidentified teleosts"; Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax); Pacific hake (Merluccius productus); and Pacific or chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus): these were also among the top six items in the previous warm-water/transitional period. As expected, pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes), relatively common in the diet during the warmer period, was absent from the diet during the cool-water period. It is suggested that during cool-water periods the thresher shark subsists on a narrow range of food items (such as anchovy and squid), but the diet becomes more diversified and opportunistic during less-productive warm-water El Nino periods.

AB  - Length-weight relationships were observed for six elasmobranch species from the Adriatic Sea. Between 2006 and 2019, data on weight and total length were collected for three shark species Alopias vulpinus, Mustelus mustelus, Mustelus punctulatus; and data on weight and disk width were collected for three batoid species Aetomylaeus bovinus, Myliobatis aquila, Pteroplatytrygon violacea. Data collection comes from monthly observations as part of a monitoring program targeting specifically bycatch on pelagic pair trawlers involved in anchovy and sardine fishing. This fishery operates using pelagic trawls with a minimum mesh size opening of 20 mm. All elasmobranchs were measured to the nearest cm using a measuring board and weighed to the nearest gram using an electronic scale or a dynamometer for the largest specimens. A linear regression analysis performed on log-transformed data was used to estimate intercept and slope, and to describe the length-weight relationship for each species.

AB  - Bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries is of substantial international concern, and the mitigation of bycatch in the Gulf of Mexico has been considered as an option to help restore lost biomass following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The most effective bycatch mitigation measures operate upon a differential response between target and bycatch species, ideally maintaining target catch while minimizing bycatch. We investigated whether bycatch vs target catch rates varied between day and night sets for the United States pelagic longline fishery in the Gulf of Mexico by comparing the influence of diel time period and moon illumination on catch rates of 18 commonly caught species/species groups. A generalized linear model approach was used to account for operational and environmental covariates, including: year, season, water temperature, hook type, bait, and maximum hook depth. Time of day or moon phase was found to significantly alter catch rates for 88% of the taxa examined. Six taxa-swordfish (Xiphias gladius Linnaeus, 1758); tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron and Lesueur, 1822); silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis Muller and Henle, 1839); oilfish (Ruvettus pretiosus Cocco, 1833); bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus Lowe, 1841); and escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum Smith, 1843)-exhibited higher catch rates at night, while eight taxa-skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis Linnaeus, 1758); wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri Cuvier, 1832); white marlin [Kajikia albida (Poey, 1860]; dolphinfish (Coryphaena sp.); yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares Bonnaterre, 1788); rays (Pteroplatytrygon violacea Bonaparte, 1832, Mobulidae sp.); lancetfish (Alepisaurus sp.), and blue marlin (Makaira nigricans Lacepede, 1802)-had higher daytime catch rates. These results reveal that shifts in effort between daytime and nighttime fishing (which are highly correlated with shifts between yellowfin tuna and swordfish targeting strategies) could have substantial, species-specific effects on bycatch rates. Whether driven by fishery conditions, market influences, or management measures, such temporal shifts in the timing of pelagic longline sets may have important implications for species-specific conservation goals and warrant further consideration.

AB  - Management and conservation of marine predator species relies on a fundamental knowledge of their movements and behaviour. Pop-up satellite archival tags were used to investigate the vertical movement patterns of five blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and one thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) within the southeastern Indian Ocean. Sections of similar depth distribution, identified using a split moving window analysis, were investigated in relation to the thermal structure of the water column and activity rates. Minimum horizontal displacement of between 66 and 5,187km for blue sharks and 16km for the thresher shark were recorded over 863 tracking days. Maximum depths ranged from 540 to 807m for blue sharks and 144m for the thresher shark. All sharks displayed plasticity in their depth distribution, with diel vertical movements and surface-oriented movements the two most common patterns. Diel movement of prey is the most likely explanation for diel vertical movements of thresher and blue sharks. This study has improved our understanding of the vertical movement patterns of these pelagic predators and the relationship between their depth distribution, temperature, and activity.

AB  - From 2001 to 2006, 71 pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) were deployed on five species of pelagic shark (blue shark [Prionace glauca]; shortfin mako [Isurus oxyrinchus]; silky shark [Carcharhinus falciformis]; oceanic whitetip shark [C. longimanus]; and bigeye thresher [Alopias superciliosus]) in the central Pacific Ocean to determine speciesspecific movement patterns and survival rates after release from longline fishing gear. Only a single postrelease mortality could be unequivocally documented: a male blue shark which succumbed seven days after release. Meta-analysis of published reports and the current study (n=78 reporting PSATs) indicated that the summary effect of postrelease mortality for blue sharks was 15% (95% CI, 8.5-25.1%) and suggested that catch-and-release in longline fisheries can be a viable management tool to protect parental biomass in shark populations. Pelagic sharks displayed species-specific depth and temperature ranges, although with significant individual temporal and spatial variability in vertical movement patterns, which were also punctuated by stochastic events (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation). Pelagic species can be separated into three broad groups based on daytime temperature preferences by using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging clustering on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov Dmax distance matrix: 1) epipelagic species (silky and oceanic whitetip sharks), which spent >95% of their time at temperatures within 2 degrees C of sea surface temperature; 2) mesopelagic-I species (blue sharks and shortfin makos, which spent 95% of their time at temperatures from 9.7 degrees to 26.9 degrees C and from 9.4 degrees to 25.0 degrees C, respectively; and 3) mesopelagic-II species (bigeye threshers), which spent 95% of their time at temperatures from 6.7 degrees to 21.2 degrees C. Distinct thermal niche partitioning based on body size and latitude was also evident within epipelagic species.

AB  - The Huron-Erie interlobate zone passes near Woodstock, Ontario. Three large limestone quarries (Zorra, Beachville West, Beachville East) provide exposures up to 30 m high of the drift stratigraphy. Grain size, matrix carbonate, color, structure, fabric, lithology, and sequence, along with continuous tracing of contacts and facies changes, allowed recognition of ten tills and related water-laid sediments correlated with the known stratigraphy in surrounding areas. Four major glacial events are recognized, three of Late Wisconsinan age. Three tongues of red, Erie lobe Canning Till (unknown age) are overlain by a Nissouri Stadial ( 2-17 ka) Catfish Creek Drift complex (two till tongues, regional southwest ice flow). Similar, apparently correlative, glacial and non-glacial sediment sequences within Catfish Creek Drift at Zorra and Beachville West (Centreville Member) suggest a northwest-southeast-trending ice margin. Overlying this are Erie Interstadial (16 ka) glaciolacustrine sediments (Rayside beds), Port Bruce Stadial (15-14 ka) Erie lobe Port Stanley Till, glaciolacustrine Zorra beds, and final Port Bruce Stadial Huron lobe Tavistock Till (three tongues), and deglacial outwash (Dunn's Corner gravels). Repeated glaciolacustrine sedimentation between tills may relate to glacioisostatically reduced gradients and nearby ice lobe margins. There is little evidence of Catfish Creek interlobate conditions and only independent lobal glacial advances later.

AB  - Dinemoura discrepans Cressey, 1967 (Copepoda, Siphonostomatoida, Pandaridae) is redescribed based on the specimens taken from four species of sharks caught off the southeast coast of Taiwan. The four species of sharks are: pelagic thresher, Alopias pelagicus Nakamura; bigeye thresher, A. superciliosus Lowe; blacktip shark. Carcharhinus limbatus (Muller et Henle); and oceanic whitetip shark, C. longimanus (Poey). Although our redescription shows certain differences from the original description, after re-examination of the museum specimens studied by R. F. Cressey in making the original description, it was confirmed that the specimens from off Taiwan are identifiable with D. discrepans. Carcharhinus limbatus is currently known to host 19 species of parasitic copepods, of which D. discrepans is the first one of this copepod genus.

AB  - Shark fins have become a highly valued commodity with the major Asian fin-trade centres supplied from global sources, including Chile. With growing concerns about the resilience of shark populations to heavy fishing pressure, there is a need for better information on shark landings to aid management efforts. In the widespread absence of shark landing records especially by species, monitoring the fin trade has been proposed as a way to assess species exploitation levels. Here, the first species assessment of the Chilean shark-fin trade was provided. The goals of this study were to (1) determine the species composition and relative species proportion of sharks utilized in the fin trade, (2) determine the relationship between fin trader market names and species and (3) assess trader accuracy in identifying shark fin species based on fin photographs. Fins were analysed from two different fin drying facilities (n = 654) (secaderos) and two fin-storage warehouses (n = 251). In contrast to official government landing records that only document four species in the landings, molecular species identification of the fins demonstrated that at least 10 pelagic shark species are present in the north-central Chilean shark fin trade: Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus, Carcharhinus obscurus, Galeorhinus galeus, Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, Lamna nasus, Prionace glauca, Sphyrna lewini, Sphyrna zygaena. The species composition of the fins from the secaderos was P. glauca (83.9%), I. oxyrinchus (13.6%), L. nasus (1.7%) and A. superciliosus (0.2%). There was generally good agreement between market names and single shark species for the trade categories 'Azulejo', 'Tiburon', 'Tintorera', 'Cola de zorro' and 'Martillo'. In contrast, the market category 'Carcharhinus' consisted of a mixture of at least five species. The molecular results also identified two species (S. lewini and I. paucus) not previously recorded in Chilean waters. The fin identification survey given to nine regional traders demonstrated that they were highly accurate in recognizing pictures of fins from P. glauca and I. oxyrinchus. The overall strong concordance between market categories and fins from single species and the trader accuracy in survey fin identification suggests that monitoring the Chilean fin trade by market names will provide a reasonably accurate picture of the volume of sharks landed by species.

AB  - Organic contaminant and total mercury concentrations were compared in four species of lamniform sharks over several age classes to examine bioaccumulation patterns and gain insights into trophic ecology. Contaminants found in young of the year (YOY) sharks were assumed to be derived from maternal sources and used as a proxy to investigate factors that influence maternal offloading processes. YOY white (Carcharodon carcharias) and mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) sharks had comparable and significantly higher concentrations of PCBs, DDTs, pesticides, and mercury than YOY thresher (Alopias vulpinus) or salmon (Lamna ditropis) sharks. A significant positive relationship was found between YOY contaminant loads and maternal trophic position, suggesting that trophic ecology is one factor that plays an important role in maternal offloading. Differences in organic contaminant signatures and contaminant concentration magnitudes among species corroborated what is known about species habitat use and may be used to provide insights into the feeding ecology of these animals.

AB  - The human ingestion of mercury (Hg) from sea food is of big concern worldwide due to adverse health effects, and more specifically if shark consumption constitutes a regular part of the human diet. In this study, the total mercury (THg) concentration in muscle tissue were determined in six sympatric shark species found in a fishing vessel seized in the Galapagos Marine Reserve in 2017. The THg concentrations in shark muscle samples (n = 73) varied from 0.73 mg kg-1 in bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias superciliosus) to 8.29 mg kg-1 in silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis). A typical pattern of Hg bioaccumulation was observed for all shark species, with significant correlation between THg concentration and shark size for bigeye thresher sharks, pelagic thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus) and silky sharks. Regarding human health concerns, the THg mean concentration exceeded the maximum weekly intake fish serving in all the studied species. Mass-Dependent Fractionation (MDF, ?202Hg values) and Mass-Independent Fractionation (MIF, ?199Hg values) of Hg in whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) and silky sharks, ranged from 0.70%o to 1.08%o, and from 1.97%o to 2.89%o, respectively. These high values suggest that both species are feeding in the epipelagic zone (i.e. upper 200 m of the water column). While, blue sharks (Prionace glauca), scalloped hammerhead sharks (Shyrna lewini) and thresher sharks were characterized by lower ?199Hg and ?202Hg values, indicating that these species may focus their foraging behavior on prey of mesopelagic zone (i.e. between 200 and 1000 m depth). In conclusion, the determination of THg concentration provides straight-forward evidence of the human health risks associated with shark consumption, while mercury isotopic compositions constitute a powerful tool to trace the foraging strategies of these marine predators.
   Capsule: A double approach combining Hg concentrations with stable isotopes ratios allowed to assess ontogeny in common shark species in the area of the Galapagos Marine Reserve and the human health risks concern associated to their consumption.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - New host records for Campula oblonga Cobbold, 1858 from the common dolphin. Delphinus delphis L., and from the thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus (Bonnaterre), are reported herein. Campulids have not been reported previously from a host that was not a marine mammal. The excellent condition and small size of the gravid specimen and the diet and natural history of the thresher shark lead us to conclude that the digene was acquired from the consumption of infected fish. Specimens of C. oblonga from these 2 hosts and from harbor porpoises, Phocoena phocoena (L.), and from Dall's porpoises, Phocoenoides dalli (True). are compared, and a wide variation in ranges and values for characters is noted. The synonymy of Campula folium Ozaki. 1935 with C. oblonga is further supported by the apparent effect of the host on the size of the trematodes. Due to the degree of variation in measurements and the numerous factors that may impact these values, we recommend the use of qualitative morphologic characters for the identification of C. oblonga.

AB  - Slasher is the first open 1/10 scale autonomous driving platform for exploring the use of neuromorphic event cameras for fast driving in unstructured indoor and outdoor environments. Slasher features a DAVIS event-based camera and ROS computer for perception and control. The DAVIS camera provides high dynamic range, sparse output, and sub-millisecond latency output for the quick visual control needed for fast driving. A race controller and Bluetooth remote joystick are used to coordinate different processing pipelines, and a low-cost ultra-wide-band (UWB) positioning system records trajectories. The modular design of Slasher can easily integrate additional features and sensors. In this paper, we show its application in a reflexive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) steering controller trained by end-to-end learning. We present preliminary experiments in closed-loop indoor and outdoor trail driving.

AB  - The ability of activity modulators of ornithine transcarbamoylase (OCT) from the liver of the thresher shark Alopias vulpinus to stabilize the enzyme against thermal denaturation was investigated in the tri-buffer at pH 7.8, at temperatures ranging from 60 to 70 degrees C, in the presence of polyhydroxylic molecules such as glycerol and sugars. The study indicated that in the presence of 0.5 M sugars and 1.6 M glycerol in the preincubation medium the OCT activity increases. When trehalose is introduced directly in the reaction mixture in a range of concentration of 0.25-0.5 M, the activity is lower than that with maltose, glycerol and buffer alone. Kinetic data for carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine with and without maltose and glycerol are similar, whereas trehalose increases the kinetic values. Arrhenius plots show an increase of activation energy due to trehalose, whereas values obtained with maltose and glycerol are similar to the control

AB  - Chilean Needle Grass has been described as being potentially the worst environmental weed of native grasslands in South-eastern Australia and its potential distribution has been estimated to be more than 41 million ha. This research involves experiments as well as modeling and simulation of the flow and spreading of Chilean Needle Grass during slashing. Fluent, Computational Fluid Dynamic package (CFD) is employed to investigate the inherent complexities of the slashing process using a virtual slasher model and simulating the slashing process and spreading of Chilean Needle Grass involving also blade mechanics. This approach aims to develop new slasher designs capable of reducing Chilean Needle Grass spread. High accuracy of the simulations is realized through validation with experimental data. Tuft method and pressure profile measurements were performed in the wind tunnel, these experiments resulting in data about the flow pressure patterns inside the slasher deck unit. The real slashing process of Chilean Needle Grass was performed in the field, the slashing action was visualized using dyes and digital video filming while the spreading of the slashed grass was carefully mapped. These experiments helped achieve a reliable CAD-CFD slasher model, which appears to be the most effective method of analyzing the slashing process to date. The main benefit of the developed computational models is in greatly reduced trial time and the possibility of investigating a wide range of data including the effect of different slasher geometries on the spreading levels. These simulations assist the investigation into the effects of various slasher blades and deck geometries and the influence that dimensions, density, shape and other Chilean Needle Grass properties have on the slashing process and on the flow inside the slasher deck. These simulations and experiments also clarify the problem of hygiene and deficiencies of present designs, which cause attaching of grass and seeds to the slasher and subsequent spreading.

AB  - Simple Summary A new integrated ecological risk assessment (ERA) including the IUCN Red List category, the body weight variation trend of 1989-2011 with large sample size (n > 678,000), and the inflection point of population growth curve coupled with the ERA was developed to assess the impact of longline fishery on the pelagic sharks in the western North Pacific. The intrinsic rate of population growth was used to estimate the productivity, and the susceptibility was estimated by the multiplication of the catchability, selectivity, and post-capture mortality. Five groups were identified based on the cluster analysis coupling with non-parametric multi-dimensional scaling. Rigorous management measures are recommended for the scalloped hammerhead, silky, and spinner shark at highest risk, setting total allowable catch quota is recommended for the bigeye thresher, and sandbar shark, and a consistent monitoring scheme is suggested for the smooth hammerhead, shortfin mako, pelagic thresher, oceanic whitetip, and dusky shark. The vulnerability of 11 pelagic shark species caught by the Taiwanese coastal and offshore longline fisheries in the western North Pacific were assessed by an ecological risk assessment (ERA) and 10 of the 11 species was assessed by using an integrated ERA developed in this study. The intrinsic rate of population growth was used to estimate the productivity of sharks, and the susceptibility of sharks was estimated by the multiplication of the catchability, selectivity, and post-capture mortality. Three indices namely, the IUCN Red List category, the body weight variation trend, and the inflection point of population growth curve coupled with ERA were used to conduct an integrated ERA. The results indicated that the scalloped hammerhead is at the highest risk (group 1), followed by the silky shark, and the spinner shark at high risk (group 2). The bigeye thresher, and sandbar shark fall in group 3, the smooth hammerhead falls in group 4, and the shortfin mako, pelagic thresher, oceanic whitetip, and dusky shark fall in group 5. Rigorous management measures for the species in groups 1 and 2, setting total allowable catch quota for group 3, and consistent monitoring schemes for groups 4 and 5 are recommended.

AB  - The incidental bycatch of sea turtle in tuna and swordfish fisheries is currently recognized as one of the major threats to the populations of these species. Therefore a number of mitigation measures have been tested, particularly for longline fisheries targeting swordfish. As mitigation measures may also affect the fish catches, it is important to quantify these impacts both at the ecological and socio-economic levels. Between August 2008 and December 2011, a total of 202 experimental pelagic longline sets were carried out in the Tropical Northeast Atlantic Ocean. The combination J-hook baited with squid (traditionally used by the fishery) was compared against two circle hooks (one non-offset and one with 100 offset) and mackerel bait. Catches per unit effort (CPUE) were calculated and compared between the different hook style and bait combinations for all target, bycatch and discarded fish species. In addition, a GLM (generalized linear model) was applied for swordfish Xiphias gladius and blue shark Prionace glauca (two main target species) and bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus (most discarded species). The swordfish catches were negatively affected when changing from the traditional gear (J-style hooks baited with squid) to one of the experimental combinations, with the bait type having a stronger influence than the hook style on this reduction. However, the overall target species CPUE and the value of the retained catch (VPUE, value per unit of effort) were not significantly affected, due to an increase on the blue shark CPUE. Furthermore, the hook style and the bait type did not seem to influence the at-haulback mortality rates of most discarded species, which were highly species-specific. Given the apparent lack of impact on the overall value of the retained catch, the use of circle hooks baited with mackerel on this particular fishery and region would be highly beneficial for sea turtle conservation, without affecting the economic viability of the fishery.

AB  - Volcanic eruptions have an impact on the paleoecology of plant communities and their preservation in the fossil record. The aim of this contribution is to evaluate the influence of volcanism on plant preservation in lacustrine settings via systematic sampling and chemical analyses of fossil plants in the Upper Triassic Agua de la Zorra Formation, of the Argentinian Cuyana Basin. Plant remains are not uniformly preserved throughout the Agua de la Zorra Formation and their stratigraphic distribution reflects the original spatial pattern of the plant communities. SEM-EDX analyses was used to demonstrate how volcanism affected diagenesis of the plant remains. Eight taphonomic modes were determined from biostratinomic analysis, and three preservationsl modes from the chemical features observed in the SEM-EDX spectra. The three preservation modes recognized by SEM-EDX analysis are more likely linked to diagenesis and are not equivalent to the taphonomic modes described based on the biostratinomic features. The Agua de la Zorra paleolake preferentially preserved plant material because of anoxic conditions in deeper parts of the lake, and a high sedimentation rate in proximal near-shore facies. The plant remains are most abundant in sandy facies deposited by high-energy flows but there is no evidence that these flows were pyroclastic nor that the plant remains were generated by volcanic trauma.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted in Auburn, AL in 2008 and 2009 to assess new aryloxyphenoxypropionate (AOPP) herbicides applied alone and tank-mixed with triclopyr for Tifway bermudagrass control in Zorro zoysiagrass. Treatments included three sequential applications of clodinafop (0.07 kg ai ha(-1)); triclopyr (1.12 kg ae clodinafop + triclopyr (0.07 + 1.12 kg ha(-1)); fenoxaprop (0.10 kg ai ha(-1)); fenoxaprop + triclopyr (0.10 + 1.12 kg ha(-1)); metamifop (0.40 kg ai ha(-1)); and metamifop + triclopyr (0.40 + 1.12 kg ha(-1)). Clodinafop, fenoxaprop, and metamifop applied alone controlled Tifway bermudagrass 32 to 65% when rated 3 wk after the final application; however, the addition of triclopyr to these AOPP herbicides increased bermudagrass control to >= 89%. All AOPP herbicides applied alone caused unacceptable injury to Zorro zoysiagrass (20 to 42%) 3 wk after the final application. Clodinafop resulted in the greatest zoysiagrass injury (42%), whereas metamifop caused moderate injury (20%). Zorro zoysiagrass exhibited less injury (< 3%) and greater turf coverage >= 95%) when AOPP herbicides were tank-mixed with triclopyr. Of the three AOPP herbicides evaluated in this study, only fenoxaprop is currently labeled for use on turfgrass. However, the nonlabeled herbicides (clodinafop and metamifop) provided bermudagrass control and zoysiagrass safety equal to the commercial standard (fenoxaprop) 3 wk after the final application when tank-mixed with triclopyr. Where zoysiagrass is contaminated with bermudagrass, turf managers will likely have to make applications of AOPP herbicides tank-mixed with triclopyr over multiple years to control bermudagrass as it will continue to regrow from deep rhizomes.

AB  - Trophic pathways and size-based bioaccumulation rates of total mercury were evaluated among recreationally caught albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus), and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) from offshore southern New England waters of the northwest Atlantic Ocean between 2008 and 2011. Mercury concentrations were highest in mako (2.65 +/- 1.16 ppm) and thresher sharks (0.87 +/- 0.71 ppm), and significantly lower in teleosts (albacore, 0.45 +/- 0.14 ppm; yellowfin, 0.32 +/- 0.09 ppm; dolphinfish, 0.20 +/- 0.17 ppm). The relationship between body size and mercury concentration was positive and linear for tunas, and positive and exponential for sharks and dolphinfish. Mercury increased exponentially with delta N-15 values, a proxy for trophic position, across all species. Results demonstrate mercury levels are positively related to size, diet and trophic position in sharks, tunas, and dolphinfish, and the majority of fishes exhibited concentrations greater than the US EPA recommended limit.

AB  - BackgroundChickpea is an important legume and is moderately tolerant to salinity stress during the growing season. However, the level and mechanisms for salinity tolerance can vary among accessions and cultivars. A large family of CaRab-GTP genes, previously identified in chickpea, is homologous to intracellular vesicle trafficking superfamily genes that play essential roles in response to salinity stress in plants.ResultsTo determine which of the gene family members are involved in the chickpea salt response, plants from six selected chickpea accessions (Genesis 836, Hattrick, ICC12726, Rupali, Slasher and Yubileiny) were exposed to salinity stress and expression profiles resolved for the major CaRab-GTP gene clades after 5, 9 and 15days of salt exposure. Gene clade expression profiles (using degenerate primers targeting all members of each clade) were tested for their relationship to salinity tolerance measures, namely plant biomass and Na+ accumulation. Transcripts representing 11 out of the 13 CaRab clades could be detected by RT-PCR, but only six (CaRabA2, -B, -C, -D, -E and -H) could be quantified using qRT-PCR due to low expression levels or poor amplification efficiency of the degenerate primers for clades containing several gene members. Expression profiles of three gene clades, CaRabB, -D and -E, were very similar across all six chickpea accessions, showing a strongly coordinated network. Salt-induced enhancement of CaRabA2 expression at 15days showed a very strong positive correlation (R-2=0.905) with Na+ accumulation in leaves. However, salinity tolerance estimated as relative plant biomass production compared to controls, did not correlate with Na+ accumulation in leaves, nor with expression profiles of any of the investigated CaRab-GTP genes.ConclusionA coordinated network of CaRab-GTP genes, which are likely involved in intracellular trafficking, are important for the salinity stress response of chickpea plants.

AB  - 'Zorro' black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (Reg. No. CV-288, PI 656394), developed by the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station was released in 2008 as an upright, midseason, disease-resistant cultivar. Zorro was developed from a backcross population using pedigree selection to the F-4 followed by pure line selection for disease and agronomic and quality traits. Zorro combines high yield potential with erect architecture and is among the highest-yielding contemporary black and navy bean cultivars. Zorro has excellent resistance to lodging, making it suitable for direct harvest under narrow production systems. The upright architecture also contributes to avoidance to white mold [caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary], a disease aggravated by narrow rows. Zorro possesses partial resistance to common bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Smith) Vauterin et al.] and resistance to specific races of rust [incited by Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers.:Pers.) Unger], virus, and anthracnose [caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. & Magnus) Lams.-Scrib.]. Zorro has a small opaque dry bean seed typical of the black bean seed class that meets the standards of national and international markets. The canning quality of Zorro is equivalent to other black bean cultivars as it retains more black color following processing.

AB  - Evidence for severe declines in large predatory fishes is increasing around the world. Because of its long history of intense fishing, the Mediterranean Sea offers a unique perspective on fish population declines over historical timescales. We used a diverse set of records dating back to the early 19th and mid 20th century to reconstruct long-term population trends of large predatory sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We compiled 9 time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records. Generalized linear models were used to extract instantaneous rates of change from each data set, and a meta-analysis was conducted to compare population trends. Only 5 of the 20 species we considered had sufficient records for analysis. Hammerhead (Sphyrna spp.), blue (Prionace glauca), mackerel (Isurus oxyrinchus and Lamna nasus), and thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) declined between 96 and 99.99% relative to their former abundance. According to World Conservation Union (IUCN) criteria, these species would be considered critically endangered. So far, the lack of quantitative population assessments has impeded shark conservation in the Mediterranean Sea. Our study fills this critical information gap, suggesting that current levels of exploitation put large sharks at risk of extinction in the Mediterranean Sea. Possible ecosystem effects of these losses involve a disruption of top-down control and a release of midlevel consumers.

AB  - Modelled upon American slasher film tropes, Omar Ali Khan's Zibahkhana (2007) is more than a transnational remake. It is a vision of a queer revolution, and imagines queer futures brought about through rural anarchy and violent eroticism. This article reads the masked killer of Zibahkhana as a monstrous queer agency armed with a queer (zombie) militia prepared to consume and transform the heteronormative matrix. Offering an unprecedented and unapologetic representation of queer aggression onscreen, Khan's indie slasher explores queer articulations of desire and anarchy in the figure of the killer, Baby, a queer woman and a murderous cannibal. With Baby, Zibahkhana offers a queer anti-hero, the first of its kind for Pakistani cinema, that challenges normative modes of being, belonging, and desiring. Thus Zibahkhana not only offers a welcome revision of Western slasher film tropes, it blazes a trail for transgressive and incendiary portrayals of queer embodiments and intimacies in Pakistani visual media.

AB  - In 1992, Candyman (Bernard Rose) made history by featuring the first African American villain in a big slasher production. Nearly thirty years later, Jordan Peele and Nia DaCosta have brought back the killer with the hook to explore the current state of the fight against racism in the United States. This article explores the ways in which the new Candyman (Nia DaCosta, 2021) leverages its status as a sequel to examine the notions of legacy and memory inherent both in the Candyman legend and in the reclamation of the stories of victims of racist violence. It is argued that the film uses its place in the saga, the conventions of the slasher genre, and the visual mythology originally established by Rose to create an intricate metafictional game exploring the problems of confronting a traumatic past. Central to this discussion is the motif of the mirror, whose importance to the story is related to the numerous narrative and visual parallels between the two films, and to the call made to the audience to reflect on an uncomfortable reality that is given an enduring form through art.

AB  - Shark take, driven by vast demand for meat and fins, is increasing. We set out to gain insights into the impact of small-scale longline fisheries in Peru. Onboard observers were used to document catch from 145 longline fishing trips (1668 fishing days) originating from Ilo, southern Peru. Fishing effort is divided into two seasons: targeting dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus; December to February) and sharks (March to November). A total of 16,610 sharks were observed caught, with 11,166 identified to species level. Of these, 70.6% were blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 28.4% short-fin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus), and 1% were other species (including thresher (Alopias vulpinus), hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), porbeagle (Lamnus nasus), and other Carcharhinidae species (Carcharhinus brachyurus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Galeorhinus galeus). Mean +/- SD catch per unit effort of 33.6 +/- 10.9 sharks per 1000 hooks was calculated for the shark season and 1.9 +/- 3.1 sharks per 1000 hooks were caught in the dolphinfish season. An average of 83.7% of sharks caught (74.7% blue sharks; 93.3% mako sharks) were deemed sexually immature and under the legal minimum landing size, which for species exhibiting k-selected life history traits can result in susceptibility to over exploitation. As these growing fisheries operate along the entire Peruvian coast and may catch millions of sharks per annum, we conclude that their continued expansion, along with ineffective legislative approaches resulting in removal of immature individuals, has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the fishery, its target species, and ecosystem. There is a need for additional monitoring and research to inform novel management strategies for sharks while maintaining fisher livelihoods.

AB  - Using critical technocultural discourse analysis with attention to netnography and the insights of visual rhetoric, this study evaluates the online productions of 4 hijabi (veiled) French Muslim fashion influencers: Zozoliina, Lady Zorro, Salima Aliani, and the Barchamammas. We assess whether the increasing visibility of French hijabi fashion bloggers like these is changing attitudes about the integration of Muslims in France. The media construction of French Muslim identity and its resulting Islamophobia have created an 'imaginary Islam' steeped in negativism and racialised stigma, according to some scholars, to which our surveyed influencers respond, manipulating Orientalist tropes to foster ambiguities about religion, sexuality, and race. In drawing attention to dynamic, consumption-based intersections of modest fashion marketing, 'erasure,' and processes of meaning-making, we argue that hijabi French Muslim fashion bloggers are increasingly positioning themselves as 'cyberarbiters' of social transformation and shifting attitudes about the intersections of Islam, the body, and female sexuality.

AB  - The sharpest optical images of the R136 cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud are presented, allowing us for the first time to resolve members of the central core, including R136a1, the most-massive star known. These data were taken using the Gemini speckle imager Zorro in medium-band filters with effective wavelengths similar to BVRI achieving angular resolutions between 30-40 mas. All stars previously known in the literature, having V < 16 mag within the central 2 '' x 2 '', were recovered. Visual companions (>= 40 mas; 2000 au) were detected for the WN5h stars R136 a1 and a3. Photometry of the visual companion of a1 suggests it is of mid-O spectral type. Based on new photometric luminosities using the resolved Zorro imaging, the masses of the individual WN5h stars are estimated to be between 150 and 200 M (circle dot), lowering significantly the present-day masses of some of the most-massive stars known. These mass estimates are critical anchor points for establishing the stellar upper-mass function.

AB  - Population structure and genetic connectivity are pivotal contributions to the establishment of conservation strategies for fisheries management, in particular for highly migratory species that are affected by commercial fisheries. This study used partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA control region to determine the genetic structure of the bigeye thresher shark Alopias superciliosus in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. A total of 858 base pairs of mtDNA CR from 228 individuals were analyzed. The resulting nucleotide diversity () was 0.0011 +/- 0.0008 and the haplotype diversity (h) was 0.127 +/- 0.030. These are the lowest diversities registered in elasmobranchs with this genetic marker. Two genetically distinct lineages were identified, one of them represented by 3.9% of the analyzed individuals and none restricted to any particular area. Simulated scenarios of population structure, tested with AMOVA and pairwise phi(ST) did not result in significant values indicating high connectivity among all sampled groups. The absence of population structure, even between Atlantic and Indian Oceans, corroborates the high dispersal ability of this species. The low genetic diversity detected in this species and the identification of two historical lineages occurring in sympatry, one represented by a very small number of individuals, should be considered in the conservation efforts and management plans of A. superciliosus.

AB  - Morphological features of coronary arteries and incidental lesions are reported from hearts in five species of sharks, the shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrhinchus Rafinesque, thresher shark Alopias vulpinus (Bonaterre), blue shark, Prionace glauca L., the smooth dogfish, Mustelus canis (Mitchill), and spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias L. Sharks were collected from the northwestern Atlantic between June and August from 1996 to 2010. They were necropsied dockside and the hearts were preserved in buffered formalin. Routine sections including ventricle/conus arteriosus and the atrio-ventricular junctions were embedded in paraffin, stained with common histological and immunohistochemical methods and examined by brightfield microscopy. Myointimal hyperplasia, medial myo-myxomatous hyperplasia and bifurcation pads were observed commonly, and medial muscle reorientation and epicardial myeloid tissues were rare. All the above features differed in severity, prevalence and distribution depending on anatomical site and shark species/size. Morphometric analysis indicated that myomyxomatous hyperplasia is associated with luminal narrowing of blood vessels. As suggested previously, the described morphological features are most likely physiological responses to blood flow characteristics. Vascular and cardiac lesions were uncommon and included, granulomatous proliferative epicarditis with fibroepitheliomas, myxomatous epicardial expansions, medial arterial vacuolation, myocardial fibrosis, acute ventricular emboli and parasitic granulomas. The lesions of embolism, proliferative and granulomatous epicarditis and myocardial fibrosis were in all sharks associated with capture events including retained fishing hooks. The significance and aetiopathogenesis of medial vacuolation and epicardial myxomatous expansions remains unclear.

AB  - Giardia intestinalis is a microbial eukaryotic parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans and other vertebrates worldwide. The negative effect on quality of life and economics caused by G. intestinalis may be increased by its potential status as a zoonosis, or a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans. The zoonotic potential of G. intestinalis has been implied for over 2 decades, with human-infecting genotypes (belonging to the 2 major subgroups, Assemblages A and B) occurring in wildlife and domesticated animals. There are recent reports of G. intestinalis in shellfish, seals, sea lions and whales, suggesting that marine animals are also potential reservoirs of human disease. However, the prevalence, genetic diversity and effect of G, intestinalis in marine environments and the role that marine animals play in transmission of this parasite to humans are relatively unexplored. Here, we provide the first thorough molecular characterization of G. intestinalis in marine vertebrates. Using a multi-locus sequencing approach, we identify human-infecting G. intestinalis haplotypes of both Assemblages A and B in the fecal material of dolphins, porpoises, seals, herring gulls Larus argentatus, common eiders Somateria mollissima and a thresher shark Alopias vulpinus. Our results indicate that G. intestinalis is prevalent in marine ecosystems, and a wide range of marine hosts capable of harboring zoonotic forms of this parasite exist. The presence of G. intestinalis in marine ecosystems raises concerns about how this disease might be transmitted among different host species.

AB  - Lacustrine systems are complex and highly sensitive in responding to allogenic factors like tectonics, climate and volcanism but also present within lake processes that are difficult to disentangle. The Agua de la Zorra Formation (Middle-Upper Triassic) outcropping in the Paramillos de Uspallata sub-basin, Cuyana rift Basin (SW Gondwana), is composed of deltaic-fluvial-lacustrine-volcaniclastic deposits. The lacustrine system presents carbonate deposits, as almost every other sub-basin within the Cuyana rift. This makes it an exceptional case for analysing limnogeological questions in an extensional tectonic regime linked to volcanism (basalt flow and tuff deposits) and studying lacustrine carbonate in that particular setting. This study focuses on a high-resolution stratigraphic, sedimentologic, petrographic and limnogeological investigation of the Agua de la Zorra depositional system to understand its evolution through space and time; and to reconstruct the development of the carbonate factory within the palaeolake. Stratigraphic correlation of five sedimentary logs across the sub-basin allowed the identification of a deltaic-lacustrine facies association and a progradational-retrogradational stacking pattern interpreting the palaeolake as an overfilled lake basin type. Five facies associations represent a delta front, prodelta, lake margin, lake centre and volcanic episodes. The stratigraphic analysis allowed interpreting that volcanic episodes were diachronous during the evolution of the Agua de la Zorra system; the development of a well-established axial fluvial system upsection and the coeval migration of the highest accommodation point and lake centre northwards. Carbonate deposits are part of the lake margin subenvironment and immediately overlie volcanic basalts and are laterally linked to altered sandstones in contact with basalts. Their microfabric is characterised by fibro-radial spar mosaics and laminated carbonate, interpreted as inorganic authigenic calcite precipitation. This and their restricted extent support that alkaline lava flows in contact with the palaeolake water column triggered carbonate precipitation. Stratigraphic, sedimentologic, limnogeological and petrographic analyses strongly support volcanism and tectonics as the main allogenic factors controlling the Agua de La Zorra lacustrine system evolution.

AB  - Acoustic telemetry was used to identify the short-term horizontal and vertical movement patterns of the bigeye thresher shark Alopias superciliosus in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean during the summer of 1996. Two immature female sharks, 175 and 124 cm PCL (precaudal length), were tracked for 96 and 70 h, respectively, demonstrating very distinct crepuscular vertical migrations similar to those reported for the megamouth shark. The bigeye threshers stayed at 200 to 500 m depth during the day and at 80 to 130 m at night. The deepest dive extends the known depth distribution of the species to 723 m. No 'fly-glide' behavior (rapid ascents followed by slower acute-angled descents) was observed for the 2 sharks. However, the opposite behavioral pattern of slow ascents and relatively rapid descents during the night was observed. Since bigeye threshers have large eyes extending upwards onto the dorsal surface of the cranium, it may be more efficient for them to hunt prey which are highlighted against the sea surface from below. Estimated mean swimming speed over the ground ranged from 1.32 to 2.02 km h(-1), similar to swordfish and megamouth sharks, and slower than that reported for tunas, billfishes, and other pelagic sharks.

AB  - Centra of shark vertebrae from three species of Lamniformes (Alopias vulpinus, Carcharodon carcharias and Isurus oxyrinchus) and three species of Carcharhiniformes (Carcharhinus plumbeus, Carcharhinus obscurus and Prionace glauca) were imaged with laboratory microcomputed Tomography (microCT) using volume element (voxel) sizes between 16 and 24 mu m. Linear attenuation coefficients were the same in the corpus calcarea (hour-glass-shaped cone) and intermedialia of the lamniforms but were smaller in the intermedialia than in the corpus calcarea of the carcharhiniforms. All centra contained growth bands which were visible as small changes in linear attenuation coefficient. In all six cases, the cross-sections of the cones were close to circular, and the cone angles matched those reported in the literature. Cartilage canals were a prominent structure in the intermedialia of all species, 3D renderings of centra of C. obscurus and I. oxyrinchus diameters showed these canals ran radially outward from the cone walls, and canal diameters were consistent with the limited numerical values in the literature. Somewhat higher calcification levels around the periphery of cartilage canals and of outer surfaces of the intermedialia and corpus calcerea suggest microstructural variation exists at scale below that which can be resolved in the present data sets.

AB  - Lamnid sharks are regionally endothermic fishes that maintain visceral temperatures elevated above the ambient water temperature. Visceral endothermy is thought to increase rates of digestion and food processing and allow thermal niche expansion. We tested the hypothesis that, at in vivo temperatures, the endothermic shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, has higher specific activities of three digestive enzymes-gastric pepsin and pancreatic trypsin and lipase-than the thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus, and the blue shark, Prionace glauca, neither of which can maintain elevated visceral temperatures. Homogenized stomach or pancreas tissue obtained from sharks collected by pelagic longline was incubated at both 15 and 25 A degrees C, at saturating substrate concentrations, to quantify tissue enzymatic activity. The mako had significantly higher enzyme activities at 25 A degrees C than did the thresher and blue sharks at 15 A degrees C. This difference was not a simple temperature effect, because at 25 A degrees C the mako had higher trypsin activity than the blue shark and higher activities for all enzymes than the thresher shark. We also hypothesized that the thermal coefficient, or Q (10) value, would be higher for the mako shark than for the thresher and blue sharks because of its more stable visceral temperature. However, the mako and thresher sharks had similar Q (10) values for all enzymes, perhaps because of their closer phylogenetic relationship. The higher in vivo digestive enzyme activities in the mako shark should result in higher rates of food processing and may represent a selective advantage of regional visceral endothermy.

AB  - Global abundances of oceanic pelagic sharks have declined due to overfishing. Internationally protected shark species remain at risk due to indiscriminate bycatch in longline fisheries with under-reported catches affecting reliability of population assessments for management. However, the scale of under-reporting remains poorly understood. Here we use detailed shark species catch data in a global fishing hotspot to show that the discards of three globally or regionally 'Endangered' or 'Critically Endangered' species (bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus; oceanic whitetip Carcharhinus longimanus; smooth hammerhead Sphyrna zygaena) are potentially under-reported on a large scale: the total discards made by a single observed vessel in April-June 2018 in the eastern tropical Atlantic exceeded by 1.3-11.0 times the discards reported officially for these species Atlantic-wide for all of 2018. Scaling up observed catches (discards) of a single vessel to potential discards made by a single nation's fleet in the region, we estimate a mean annual total of 1526.2 t (+/- 1 S.D. range: 415.3-2637.0 t), which exceeds by 89.2 times (+/- 1 S.D. range: 24.3-154.2 times) the official reported discards for these three species. Without reducing bycatch mortality, which at present appears obscured by substantial under-reporting, Atlantic populations remain at serious risk.

AB  - Bycatch (the unintentional catch of non- target species or sizes) is consistently ranked as one of the greatest threats to marine fish populations; yet species- specific rates of bycatch survival are rarely considered in risk assessments. Regulations often require that bycatch of threatened species be released; but, if animals are already dead, their release serves no conservation purpose. We examined the survival of 12 shark species caught as bycatch in the US Atlantic pelagic longline fishery. Shark survival was evaluated in relation to fishery target (swordfish versus tuna) and four operational, environmental, and biological variables to evaluate the underlying mechanisms affecting mortality. Survival estimates ranged from 33% (night shark) to 97% (tiger shark) with seven of the 12 species being significantly affected by at least one variable. We placed our survival results within a framework that assessed each species' relative vulnerability by integrating survival estimates with reproductive potential and found that the bigeye thresher, dusky, night, and scalloped hammerhead shark exhibited the highest vulnerabilities to bycatch. We suggest that considering ecological and biological traits of species shows promise for designing effective conservation measures, whereas techniques that reduce fisheries interactions in the first place may be the best strategy for highly vulnerable species.

AB  - Microbial communities from three Argentinean saline soils were extracted and tested for their ability to degrade diesel fuel in liquid culture at salinities between 0% and 25%. In each case, the degradation process was continuously monitored by measuring oxygen consumption. Two communities (CR1 and CR2) showed nearly equal degrees of degradation across a salinity range of 0%-10% (the former degrading about 63% of the diesel fuel and the latter about 70% after 53 and 80 d, respectively). Furthermore, the degree of degradation was not significantly lower in the presence of 17.5% salt (58% and 65% degraded, respectively). A third community (El Zorro) showed a maximum turnover at 5% salt (79% diesel fuel degraded) and significant degradation (66%) at a salinity of 10%. However, the degree of degradation by this community clearly dropped at 0% and 15% salt. None of the communities were able to degrade diesel fuel in the presence of 25% salt, but the living cell counts showed that components of the microbial population survived the long-term exposure. The surviving portion is obviously sufficient to allow substantial restoration of the original community, as verified by the BIOLOG method. Isolates of the CRI community were identified as members of the genera Cellulomonas, Bacillus, Dietzia, and Halomonas. In light of our investigations, the bioremediation of contaminated saline soils should be quite possible if the salinity of the soil water is lower than 15% or if it is reduced below this limit by the addition of water.

AB  - The species composition and extent of large elasmobranch bycatch in the Sardinian tuna trap fisheries have received minimal attention in the primary literature. The Sardinian Large Elasmobranch Database (SLED), a non-governmental project, contains records from direct observations, fishing industry sources and reviews from the literature regarding the extent and composition of large elasmobranch bycatch from the only six tuna traps at six fishing sites (Saline; Capo Testa; Carloforte: Portoscuso; Calasetta; and Portopaglia) from the period of 1990 to 2009. During this time period, 42 bycatch events were documented that were comprised of the incidental capture of 15 Mobulid rays and 27 large sharks representing ten species and seven families (23% of the total elasmobranch species previously reported in Sardinian waters). Even though the low number of collective elasmobranchs captured (n = 42) in this study does not pose a conservation concern several bycatch species considered rare and/or depleted in this region were among the species observed. Mobula mobular was the most abundant elasmobranch species caught, with Alopias vulpinus the most commonly caught shark species. There were differences in the catch per unit effort between the six sites with the highest CPUE occurring in Saline, Carloforte and Porto Paglia. Although the sheer volume and conservation impact of traditional tuna traps on large elasmobranchs is exceeded by other fishing gears in Mediterranean waters, small scale (long term) bycatch monitoring programs are vital when evaluating the presence, biodiversity and conservation of elasmobranchs in previously unstudied areas.

AB  - This comparative study of the radial testes of sexually mature thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) and shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) describes the histology of the three-tiered network of sperm-carrying ductules in the testis and the lymphomyeloid tissue associated with it, namely the epigonal organ. In both species, a testis epigonal gradient was evident regarding the thickness of the ductule epithelial lining and subepithelial investment of connective tissue. Ductules straddling the testis-epigonal border often displayed luminal leukocytes and various signs of regression, including the progressive thickening of the ductule epithelial lining, dissolution of the cytoplasm, and loss of normal histoarchitecture. In Isurus, large amorphous areas formed due to the fusion of neighboring regressing ductules. The epigonal organ of Alopias additionally revealed circular degenerative sperm-containing, Hassall-like bodies with either a degenerate or cellular appearance, the latter the result of cell proliferative activity (as shown by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry) in an expanding outer border comprising cells with intensely PCNA immunoreactive slender and oblong nuclei. The latter cells exhibited a periphery-to-center transformation of their nuclei, at which stage they were PCNA-negative and most likely in a terminally differentiated state as they phagocytized the cell debris in the degenerate core. Intermediate stages of these circular bodies were a rarity. The relationship between these degenerate bodies, and the common occurrence of blind pockets in the epithelial linings and non-apoptosis-related degenerate patches in the apical cytoplasmic regions of the irregular shaped ductules in Alopias is unclear, and needs further elucidation.

AB  - During the winter of 1991, a side-by-side comparison was made between two popular thinning systems:  a feller-buncher, grapple skidder, loader/slasher system and a harvester, forwarder system.  A first commercial thinning was conducted in an 18-year-old loblolly pine stand.  Test areas were cruised prior to thinning and remeasured after operations were completed.  The target basal area per acre was successfully met by the forwarder system but not by the skidder system.  Individual tree damage was recorded during plot remeasurement.  The skidder system scarred 25 trees per acre versus 10 trees per acre with the forwarder system.  Ground disturbance was recorded by two samples.  One focused on skidder and forwarder trails where the area in various levels of disturbance was measured along with soil bulk density.  The other sample was a systematic survey covering the entire study area and gave an overall sample of ground disturbance levels.  The skidder system had more disturbed area and compacted the soil more than the forwarder system.

AB  - An analysis of the horror films of late 1970s and early 1980s argues that although this period is usually understood as one that was dominated by the slasher film, it was actually one defined by a wave of big-budget horror films. Furthermore, through an analysis of the reception of these films in mainstream publications such as the New York Times, the article not only explores features and trends that these films were understood as exhibiting but also the broader discourses through which films were either championed or condemned by reviewers.

AB  - Coherence is a significant factor in nanoscale electronic insulator technology and necessitates an understanding of the structure-property relationship between constructive and destructive quantum interference. This is particularly important in organic dielectric circuitry, which is the subject of this work. It is known that molecular wires composed of (i) meta-substituted phenylene rings, (ii) cross-conjugated double bonds (orthogonal to the molecular long axis), and (iii) single bonds can dramatically reduce electrical transmission. Here we add to these tools the use of an unexplored molecular shape to create strong and counter-intuitive interference: a fully conjugated molecular wire with a structure that is forced back on itself in a Z shape, thereby exhibiting remarkably low conductance (G = 0.43 x 10(-9) S) even though the phenylene arrangements are ortho- rather than meta-disposed. We call these Z-shaped molecules having ultralow conduction Z-ortho-regio-resistive organics (ZORROs). Here we analyze a series of ZORRO molecules and find them to have significant insulating properties in the coherent electrontran-sport regime due to interfering transmission pathways in the phenylene rings. Importantly, we find that both electron with-drawing (fluorine) and electron-donating (methoxy) substituents enhance the transmission, which is not desirable. The former is due to the suppression of the destructive quantum interference at the F site, thereby enhancing the overall transmission, much like a Buttiker probe. The latter is due to a methoxy unit resonance additive effect, akin to oxygen doping, and positively contributes to the transmission. We then examine the effects of replacing the phenylene rings with 4,5- and 3,4-disubstituted thiophenes and how this ZORRO modification further reduces the transmission. An ultralow conductance of 0.13 x 10(-9) S and a relatively high dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) of similar to 5 are predicted for the 3,4-thiophene ZORRO derivative, which closely resembles two cross-conjugated units, making it an intriguing candidate for a gate dielectric material.

AB  - This study describes the feeding ecology of three pelagic shark species in the California Current: shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus); blue (Prionace glauca); and thresher (Alopias vulpinus) sharks. Stomach contents of sharks collected from 2002 to 2008 were identified to the lowest taxonomic level and analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Of 330 mako sharks sampled (53 to 248 cm fork length [FL]), 238 stomachs contained 42 prey taxa, with jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) and Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) representing the most important prey based on the geometric index of importance (GII). In addition, 158 blue sharks were sampled (76 to 248 cm FL) and 114 stomachs contained 38 prey taxa, with jumbo and Gonatus spp. squids representing the most important prey. Lastly, 225 thresher sharks were sampled (108 to 228 cm FL) and 157 stomachs contained 18 prey taxa with northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) identified as the most important prey. Overall, mako sharks had the most diverse diet based upon Simpson's diversity index (1/D) (8.43 +/- 1.16), feeding on many species of teleosts and cephalopods, followed by blue sharks (6.20 +/- 2.11) which consumed a wide range of prey (primarily cephalopods), while thresher sharks were most specialized (2.62 +/- 0.34), feeding primarily on coastal pelagic teleosts. Dietary overlap was lowest between blue and thresher sharks (Sorensen similarity index = 0.321 and Simplified Morisita Horn index = 0.006), and seasonal variability in diet was greatest for blue sharks (Simplified Morisita Horn index = 0.260, Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) p < 0.001). In addition, size class, and subregion were significant factors that affected diet of each species differently (ANOSIM p < 0.001). Despite similarities in life history characteristics and spatial and temporal overlap in habitat, diets of these three common shark species are distinct in the California Current.

AB  - Recent average annual catches of sharks by tuna longline vessels fishing in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) are estimated to be between 1583 and 2274 t. Although 22 shark species have been recorded by the observer programme for this fishery, 80% of the annual catch comprises only five species: blue shark Prionace glauca, silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis, bigeye thresher shark Alopias superciliosus, pelagic thresher shark Alopias pelagicus and oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus. Wire leaders (i.e. branch lines or traces) were also used by nearly all observed vessels. Generalized additive model (GAM)-based analyses of catch rates indicated that P. glauca and A. superciliosus are caught in higher numbers when vessels fish in relatively cooler waters, at night, close to the full moon, when the 27 degrees C thermocline is close to the surface and during El Nino conditions. In contrast, C. falciformis, A. pelagicus and C. longimanus are caught in higher numbers when shark lines are used (all three species) or hooks are set at a shallow depth (A. pelagicus and C. longimanus and, also, P. glauca). These findings are generally consistent with current knowledge of these species' habitat preferences, movement and distribution. The results of these analyses were combined with information pertaining to shark condition and fate upon capture to compare the likely effectiveness of a range of potential measures for reducing shark mortality in the longline fishery. Of the options considered, the most effective would be to combine measures that reduce the catch rate (e.g. restrictions on the use of wire leaders, shark baits and shark lines) with measures that increase survival rates after post-capture release (e.g. finning bans).

AB  - Through convergent evolution tunas and lamnid sharks share thunniform swimming and a medial position of the red, aerobic swimming musculature. During continuous cruise swimming these muscles move uniformly out of phase with local body curvature and the surrounding white muscle tissue. This design results in thrust production primarily from the caudal fin rather than causing whole-body undulations. The common thresher shark (Family Alopiidae) is the only other fish known to share the same medial red muscle anatomy as the thunniform swimmers. However, the overall body shape and extremely heterocercal caudal fin of the common thresher is not shared with the thunniform swimmers, which have both fusiform bodies and high aspect-ratio, lunate caudal fins. Our study used sonomicrometry to measure the dynamics of red and white muscle movement in common thresher sharks swimming in the ocean to test whether the medial position of red muscle is associated with uncoupling of muscle shortening and local body bending as characteristic of thunniform swimmers. Common threshers (similar to 60-100 kg) instrumented with sonomicrometric and electromyographic (EMG) leads swam alongside of the vessel with a tail-beat frequency of similar to 0.5 Hz. EMG signals confirmed that only the red muscle was active during sustained swimming. Despite the more medial position of the red muscle relative to the white muscle, its strain was approximately 1.5-times greater than that of the overlying white muscle, and there was a notable phase shift between strain trajectories in the red muscle and adjacent white muscle. These results suggest an uncoupling (shearing) of the red muscle from the adjacent white muscle. Although the magnitude of the phase shift between red and white muscle strain was relatively constant within individuals, it varied among sharks, ranging from near zero (red and white in phase) to almost 180 degrees out of phase. This extent in variability has not been documented previously for thunniform swimmers with a medial red muscle position and may be a characteristic of the thresher's unique body and caudal fin morphology. Nonetheless, the uncoupling of red and white muscle strain remains a consistent character associated with fishes having a medially positioned red muscle. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mitochondrial genome, through the application of DNA barcoding, provides a powerful tool for identifying species even when specimens are either incomplete or belong to species that exhibit cryptic diversity. In fisheries management accurate identification of whole or part of the specimens, landed is a fundamental requirement for the conservation of species affected directly or indirectly by the fisheries activities. In this study cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) sequences were used, to genetically distinguish 36 elasmobranch species collected from Maltese (Central Mediterranean) commercial fisheries landings. Each species was analysed using these two mtDNA loci where COI (610 bp) and ND2 (990 bp) efficiently distinguished between the various species studied, leading to the identification of 101 haplotypes, with the intraspecific p-distance ranging between 0 and 0.75% (mean 0.10%, SD +/- 0.13%). This study enhances the molecular data available on elasmobranchs by providing new ND2 sequences for various species, while providing both COI and ND2 data for poorly studied Mediterranean species including: the large pelagic sharks Alopias vulpinus, A. swerciliosus, Carcharhinus altimus, C. plumbeus, Corcharadon carcharias, Isurus oxyrinchus, Prionace glauca and Odontaspis ferox; the smaller demersal sharks Somniosus rostratus, Squatina aculeata, S. oculata and Squalus sp.; and the endemic stingray Dasyatis tortonesei. It also confirmed the landings of species whose identification relies strongly on molecular tools, namely Squalus sp. and D. tortonesei, which are both first confirmed records amongst Maltese fisheries landings. Morphologically, the latter two species, can be easily misidentified with S. blainville and D. pastinaca respectively. Additionally, this study evaluated the genetic differences between different polychromatic forms of Raja clavata, R. radula and Dipturus oxyrinchus. Based on the currently analysed specimens, no significant genetic differences were found between the various forms and thus no further speciation within the species was identified.

AB  - Drosophila suzukii, Matsumura, is a relatively new pest in the United States attacking a variety of fruit crops. Studies were conducted to develop a standardized, economical trap for monitoring. Laboratory bioassays found that flies were attracted to dark colours ranging from red to black. Similarly, fly catches in 237-ml plastic 'spice' jars with ten 0.48-cm holes and baited with apple cider vinegar were significantly higher in jars with red or black than white caps. The use of an alternating set of three, horizontal red, black and red bands ('Zorro' trap) significantly increased fly catches compared with the use of all-red or all-black strips. This increase was associated with a significantly higher proportion of flies first landing on the side near the openings of the trap instead of on the cap with the 'Zorro' trap compared with the other traps. Laboratory data were used to develop a predictive model to define total fly capture as a function of trap colour/colour pattern, cumulative area of entry holes and the length of the trapping portion of the trap. Total fly catches by the 'Zorro' trap were compared with other red and clear plastic traps in five field trials conducted in several cultivated and uncultivated sites. Comparisons included a commercial red-capped 200-ml trap with two 0.63-cm holes, an all-red spice jar with ten 0.48-cm holes and clear and red 473-ml and clear 946-ml plastic cups with six or ten 0.48-or 0.63-cm holes. The model was successfully validated, suggesting that performance of cup traps can be predicted based on a few characteristics. The current 'Zorro' trap did not catch most of the flies among trap designs, but showed some advantages, including the durability and potential to recycle the plastic, small size, commercial availability and its greater selectivity for D. suzukii than the other traps tested.

AB  - Species identification of sharks under catch or trade regulations is important for law enforcement and species conservation. Rapid detection of Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)-listed species is needed for on-site screening.
   Species-specific primers were designed to target three mitochondrial genes (ND2, COI, and CytB) in both the simplex and multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus), the bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus), and the scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini), respectively. Another primer set designed to target S. lewini was used for detection-limit testing of the LAMP assay.
   The refined direct multiplex LAMP was used to detect the three CITES-listed shark species and omitted the lengthy DNA extraction process. A homogenizer was used to release the DNA from the shark tissues, and a simplex or multiplex LAMP reaction was conducted for 30 min in an incubator at 65 degrees C using species-specific primer sets.
   Positive LAMP reactions showed a colour change from pink to yellow, whereas negative reactions showed no colour change. Multiplex LAMP assays were performed using 84 samples, which successfully identified the target and non-target species and provided a fast (<1 h), simple, and reliable method to distinguish three CITES-listed shark species from the other non-target species, for either fresh or dry fin products.
   Results of this study and the method developed will play a critical role in assisting fishery agencies and customs officials in identifying the illegal catch and trade of CITES-listed shark species.

AB  - Fishery, population parameters and stock estimates of the bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus Lowe, 1841 from the Thoothukudi coast of Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve (GoMMBR) was studied during the period 2015 to 2019. Results of the study reveals that the estimated annual average production of sharks from Thoothukudi region was 105 t of which the dominant shark species was A. supercilious (52.70%). The length of the sampled A. supercilious ranged between 108 and 265 cm. Results of the length-weight relationship showed negative allometric growth with b value of 2.66. The growth parameters viz, asymptotic length (L-infinity), growth co-efficient (K) and arbitrary origin of growth (t(0)) were estimated at 367 cm, 0.39 y(-1) and 0.12 respectively. The mortality parameters viz, total mortality (Z), fishing mortality (F) and natural mortality (M) rates were estimated at 1.20, 0.70 and 0.50 y(-1), respectively. In Thoothukudi, the recruitment season of A. superciliosus was found during March and October showing optimal exploitation with exploitation rate (E) of 0.58 and the estimated exploitation ratio (U) was 0.54. The virtual population analysis (VPA) showed a fishing pressure on the 240 to 320 cm length group. The estimated annual catch and maximum sustainable yield (MSY) were 58 and 68 t respectively. The present study gives valuable baseline information on the fishery and population characteristics of this vulnerable and data deficit resource A. superciliosus off Thoothukudi.

AB  - International trade in vulnerable marine species is regulated once they are listed in CITES Appendices (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). Parties to the Convention submit proposal(s) 150 days prior to the CITES Conference for voting on the inclusion of new species in Appendices I and II, making a case for why CITES listing criteria are met in each case. Before the vote, Parties receive advice from (a) the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, (b) the International Union for Conservation of Nature-TRAFFIC and (c) the CITES Secretariat, among others. This paper offers an expert review of listing processes, which are the subject of much debate in fishery and environment-protection communities, looking at two specific cases: silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis, Carcharhinidae) and bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus, Alopiidae). The reviewers determine that the evidence made available to voting Parties is substantial, but suffers from non-standard presentation across assessments. The best available data are not always presented or described transparently in relation to CITES criteria. An extension of the assessment period, as well as the opportunity to refute evidence, has been suggested as ways to support more informed and effective decision-making by CITES Parties, whose composition of delegations varies greatly in their experience of marine species management and trade. Experts welcomed a greater coherence of advice between fishery and non-fishery sources in the long term, and proposed a range of suggested improvements for the delivery of information and advice to CITES Parties.

AB  - Zirconium monoxide (ZrO) absorption lines define rare S-type stars and are currently being sought on exoplanets. Successful detection is dependent on an accurate and comprehensive line list, with existing data not ideal for many applications. Specifically, the Plez et al. line list is near-complete but has insufficient accuracy for high-resolution cross-correlation, while the Sorensen & Bernath data have high accuracy but only consider a small number of spectral bands. This article presents a novel spectroscopic model, variational line list, and trihybrid line list for the main (ZrO)-Zr-90-O-16 isotopologue, as well as isotopologue-extrapolated hybrid line lists for the (ZrO)-Zr-91-O-16, (ZrO)-Zr-92-O-16, (ZrO)-Zr-93-O-16, (ZrO)-Zr-94-O-16, and (ZrO)-Zr-96-O-16 isotopologues. These were constructed using Duo based on icMRCI-SD/CASSCF ab initio electronic data calculated using molpro, experimental energies obtained from a previous MARVEL data compilation, and perturbative energies from Sorensen & Bernath. The new (ZrO)-Zr-90-O-16 ExoMol-style trihybrid line list, ZorrO, comprises 227 118 energies (13 075 experimental) and 47 662 773 transitions up to 30 000 cm (-1) (333 nm) between 10 low-lying electronic states (X (1)& sigma;(+), a (3)& UDelta;, A (1)& UDelta;, b (3)& pi;, B (1)& pi;, C (1)& sigma;(+), d (3)& phi;, e (3)& pi;, f (3)& UDelta;, and F (1)& UDelta;). The inclusion of experimental energy levels in ZorrO means ZrO will be much easier to detect using high-resolution ground-based telescopes in the 12 500-17 500 cm(-1) (571-800 nm) spectral region. The inclusion of variational energy levels means that the ZorrO line list has very high completeness and can accurately model molecular absorption cross-sections even at high temperatures. The ZorrO data will hopefully facilitate the first detection of ZrO in the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter exoplanet, or alternatively more conclusively exclude its presence.

TI  - The Mask of ZoRRo: preventing information leakage from documents

KW  - Security and protection
AB  - In today's enterprise world, information about business entities such as a customer's or patient's name, address, and social security number is often present in both relational databases as well as content repositories. Information about such business entities is generally well protected in databases by well-defined and fine-grained access control. However, current document retrieval systems do not provide user-specific, fine-grained redaction of documents to prevent leakage of information about business entities from documents. Leaving companies with only two choices: either providing complete access to a document, risking potential information leakage, or prohibiting access to the document altogether, accepting potentially negative impact on business processes. In this paper, we present ZoRRo, an add-on for document retrieval systems to dynamically redact sensitive information of business entities referenced in a document based on access control defined for the entities. ZoRRo exploits database systems' fine-grained, label-based access-control mechanism to identify and redact sensitive information from unstructured text, based on the access privileges of the user viewing it. To make on-the-fly redaction feasible, ZoRRo exploits the concept of -safety in combination with Lucene-based indexing and scoring. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of ZoRRo through a detailed experimental study.

AB  - Peroxidases play an important role in plant stress related interactions. This research assessed the role of peroxidases in the defense response of resistant and susceptible buffalograsses [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm] and zoysiagrasses (Zoysia japonica Steudel) to the western chinch bug, Blissus occiduus Barber. The objectives were: (1) to assess the relationships among protein content, basal peroxidase levels, chinch bug injury, and ploidy levels of chinch bug-resistant and -susceptible buffalograsses; (2) to compare peroxidase activity levels of resistant and susceptible buffalograsses and zoysiagrasses in response to chinch bug feeding; (3) and to analyze extracted proteins from chinch bug-resistant and -susceptible buffalograsses and zoysiagrasses by native gel electrophoresis to obtain information on the peroxidase profiles. Correlation analyses of 28 buffalograss genotypes with varying levels of chinch bug resistance and ploidy levels indicated that buffalograss total protein content was correlated (r = 0.47, P = 0.01) to chinch bug injury, while basal peroxidase levels was not (r = 0.19, P = 0.29), suggesting that the up-regulation of peroxidases in resistant buffalograsses is a direct response to chinch bug feeding. Three of the four chinch bug-resistant buffalograss genotypes evaluated had higher peroxidase activity in the infested plants compared to control plants. Peroxidase activity levels were similar between infested and control plants of the two highly susceptible buffalograss genotypes. Zoysiagrasses had lower peroxidase activity in general when compared to buffalograss control plants, and only 'Zorro' consistently showed higher peroxidase activity in the infested plants. Native gel electrophoresis analysis identified differences in the isozyme profiles of infested and control buffalograsses 'Prestige' and 196, and the zoysiagrass 'Zorro'. Results from this study suggest that peroxidases have the potential to be used as markers for selecting chinch bug resistant turfgrasses, and may help explain how plants defend themselves against biotic stresses, such as chinch bugs.

AB  - The pelagic elasmobranchs fishery of multiday gillnetters (MGNs) of Tharuvaikulam, Thoothukudi was studied during 2015-2016. Fishery data revealed that MGNs targeting scombrids and other large pelagic fishes also contribute to the pelagic elasmobranch landings accounting for 7.67 and 5.3% of total elasmobranchs landed at Tharuvaikulam during 2015 and 2016 respectively. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) varied from 2.09 to 175 kg (2015) and 13 to 124.95 kg (2016). In total, 15 species of pelagic elasmobranchs were recorded during the study period, which includes 7 species of sharks and 8 species of rays. The pelagic elasmobranchs fishery of Tharuvaikulam depends mainly on two species namely bigeye thresher, Alopias supetriliosus and spinetail devilray, Mobula japanica. The geospatial mapping revealed that fishing grounds of MGNs was between 77 degrees to 80 degrees E longitudes and 7 degrees to 9 degrees N latitudes with depth ranging from 50 to 200 m. The persistence of fishing grounds of pelagic elasmobranchs was identified by classifying the fishing areas of Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve (GOMBR) into seven zones. The results showed that more fishing happens in Zone 4, off Thoothukudi between 78 degrees to 79 degrees E and 8 degrees to 9 degrees N followed by Zone 7, off Kanyakumari between 77 degrees to 78 degrees E and 7 degrees to 8 degrees N. Seasonal analysis revealed that along with the targeted groups, the CPUE of pelagic elasmobranchs was higher during the pre-monsoon season. The present paper illustrates the zonal distribution of pelagic elasmobranchs in the fishing grounds of MGNs in GOMBR, along the south-east coast of India and the results of the study would serve as baseline information for formulating future management plans.

AB  - The bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus, is a commercially important species caught as a target and bycatch in Ecuadorian fisheries by artisanal fleets. However, information on its biology and ecology in the Southeastern Pacific Ocean is scarce and regulatory measures are lacking. It is considered a vulnerable species with a decreasing population trend. In the present study, we report on the reproductive biology of A. superciliosus landed in the Ecuadorian Pacific Ocean. A total of 133 specimens (46% females and 54% males) were examined from October 2012 to September 2013. The size range of females and males was 119-402 cm total length (TL, x over bar = 280.7 +/- 50.3) and 132-341 cm TL (x over bar = 277.3 +/- 47.3), respectively. The sex ratio (0.9 F:1.0 M) was not significantly different from the expected ratio 1:1; the sex ratio in embryos was not different either (1 F:1.0 M). The mean size at maturity (L50) was estimated at 315.7 cm TL for females and 275.2 cm TL for males. Gravid females were recorded from April-September 2013 and ranged between 322 and 361 cm TL (x over bar = 336.6 +/- 13.7). Fecundity was two embryos for each female and one embryo per uterus, and the size at birth was 122 cm TL after a gestation of twelve months. The births probably occurred in August. A description of three stages of embryos is included. The present study provides biological information on Alopias superciliosus, which can help in the development of fishery management plans for the conservation of the species. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We present Zorro, a taped-out ASIC hosting three distinct authenticated encryption architectures based on the SPONGEWRAP construction. All designs target resource-constrained environments such as smart cards or embedded devices and therefore, have been protected against DPA attacks while keeping low-area as the most important design goal in mind. Each of the three architectures contains masking and hiding countermeasures. They solely differ with regard to the implemented secret-sharing scheme. While the first design is based on a 3-share threshold implementation (TI), which does not fulfill the uniformity property, the other two make use of the 3-share approach with re-masking and the 4-share approach as proposed by Bilgin et al. Our smallest, provable first-order DPA secure Keccak implementation requires only 14.5 kGE (which is less than half of the size of related work) and contains both front-end and back-end design overheads. Moreover, we present first DPA results of the Zorro ASIC by comparing hiding and masking countermeasures. We were able to recover the cipherkey from a masking-secured TI implementation based on three shares with about 70 000 power traces.

AB  - The bigeye thresher, Alopias supercilious, is commonly caught as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries targeting swordfish. Little information is yet available on the biology of this species, however. As part of an ongoing study, observers sent aboard fishing vessels have been collecting set of information that includes samples of vertebrae, with the aim of investigating age and growth of A. supercilious. A total of 117 specimens were sampled between September 2008 and October 2009 in the tropical northeastern Atlantic, with specimens ranging from 101 to 242 cm fork length (FL) (176 to 407 cm total length). The A. supercilious vertebrae were generally difficult to read, mainly because they were poorly calcified, which is typical of Lamniformes sharks. Preliminary trials were carried out to determine the most efficient band enhancement technique for this species, in which crystal violet section staining was found to be the best methodology. Estimated ages in this sample ranged from 2 to 22 years for females and 1 to 17 years for males. A version of the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGF) re-parameterised to estimate L(0), and a modified VBGF using a fixed L(0) were fitted to the data. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare these models. The VBGF produced the best results, with the following parameters: L(inf) = 293 cm FL, k = 0.06 y(-1) and L(0) = 111 cm FL for females; L(inf) = 206 cm FL, k = 0.18 y(-1) and L(0) = 93 cm FL for males. The estimated growth coefficients confirm that A. supercilious is a slow-growing species, highlighting its vulnerability to fishing pressure. It is therefore urgent to carry out more biological research to inform fishery managers more adequately and address conservation issues.

AB  - Accurately quantifying the rates dM/d t at which massive stars lose mass is essential to any understanding of their evolution. All dM/dt estimates to date assume wind clumping factors; not allowing for clumping leads to overestimates of d M/dt and underestimates of lifetimes and masses when these stars explode as supernovae. Mid-infrared spectroscopy suggested that the wind of the nearest Wolf-Rayet (WR) star,.2 Vel, is resolved with a full width at 10 per cent intensity of 0.5 arcsec, or 171 au at the 342 pc distance of the star. As the Zorro speckle imager on Gemini South is capable of similar to 0.02 arcsec resolution, we have used it to image.2 Vel at two orbital phases (0.30 and 0.44) with two narrow-band and two intermediate-band filters in an attempt to resolve its wind. Our observations demonstrate that.2 Vel's wind may be resolved as a similar to 0.07 arcsec westward elongation through an 832 nm filter at orbital phase 0.3. If confirmed, this is the smallest scale (similar to 24 au) at which a WR star wind asymmetry has been directly imaged. Similar imaging at multiple phases is needed to determine if the asymmetry is due to stochastic wind clumping, co-rotating interaction regions or colliding-wind, cone-shaped shocks.

AB  - A barrier, to widespread zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) use is its slow establishment rate. Our objectives were to quantify differences in establishment rate of zoysiagrass cultivars and genotypes as well as determine the underlying factors associated with differential growth rates. Thirty-five genotypes of zoysiagrass were transplanted into field plots in June 2004 and 2005. Establishment rate and stolon growth of zoysiagrass grass genotypes were measured in the field and then four cultivars with contrasting establishment rate were used for further growth analysis in a growth chamber: Mean establishment rate [log(e) (coverage) d(-1)] and coverage (cm(2)) 91 d after planting (DAP) in the field were faster for Z. japonica. than Z. matrella genotypes. The Z. japonica Genotype 6186 had the greatest coverage 91 DAP. 'EI Toro', 'Chinese Common', and 'Palisades' were among the Z. japonica genotypes that produced more coverage 91 DAP than the mean (1943 cm(2)), while 'Meyer' produced, less coverage than the mean. 'Zorro' was among the fastest establishing Z. matrella genotypes, and 'Diamond' was the slowest. Growth analysis indicated EI Toro and Zorro, which establish faster than Meyer and Diamond, partition more dry matter to stolons and rhizomes than leaves. This is consistent with field data where Ell Toro and Zorro have greater total stolon length than Meyer and Diamond. Zoysiagrass genotypes that partition more dry matter to stems instead of leaves, establish the quickest.

AB  - Bioerosion by microorganisms is termed microbioerosion. In aquatic systems, microbioerosion affects various substrates, most commonly relatively soluble ones such as sulfates, phosphates, and carbonates. However, the record of microbioerosion in fossil calcareous organisms in lake environments is limited. In northern Mendoza Province, at the locality Paramillos de Uspallata, Triassic sedimentary rocks outcrop, including the Agua de la Zorra Formation, which was deposited in a deltaic and lacustrine system. This study assesses possible bioerosion by microorganisms on spinicaudata shells from the lacustrine sequence and discusses their preservation potential in lacustrine environments. Spinicaudatans from the Agua de la Zorra Formation were analyzed under a binocular microscope and via scanning electron microscopy. Traces, the product of microbioerosion, preserved as molds, were assigned as Type 1 and 2 and were then compared with those generated by cyanobacteria, bacteria, chlorophyte, and fungi that inhabit fresh and brackish water environments. Microbioerosion occurs post-mortem and enhances dissolution of the spinicaudata shells. This, together with bias in extraction methodologies and sampling, is considered the reason for the rarity of spinicaudatans with traces of bioerosion in the lacustrine record.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in Belo Horizonte (State of Minas Gerais, Brazil). Leishmania sp. can naturally infect several species of mammals, and the domestic dog is the most important reservoir of the disease in South America. This report describes five cases of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazilian canids. Among 15 animals kept in captivity in a zoo in Belo Horizonte (State of Minas Gerais, Brazil), two animals, a bush dog (Spheotos venaticos) and a hoary zorro (Lycalopex vetulus) were serologically positive and developed clinical signs of VL, whereas three other canids, including a crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), a maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), and a hoary zorro (Lycalopex vetulus) had positive serological results without clinical signs.

AB  - Hooking (or "at-haulback") fishing mortality was analysed in elasmobranchs captured by Portuguese longliners targeting swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean. Information was collected by on-board fishery observers who monitored 834 longline fishing sets between August 2008 and December 2011, and recorded information on 36 067 elasmo-branch specimens from 21 different taxa. The hooking mortality proportions were species-specific, with some species having relatively high percentages of live specimens at time of haulback (e. g., blue shark, crocodile shark, pelagic stingray, manta, devil and eagle rays), while others had higher percentages of dead specimens (e. g., smooth hammerhead, silky shark, bigeye thresher). For the most captured species (Prionace glauca, Pseudocarcharias kamoharai, Isurus oxyrinchus and Alopias superciliosus), logistic generalized linear models (GLMs) were carried out to compare the mortality rates between sexes, specimen sizes and the regions of operation of the fleet. The sex-specific proportions of hooking mortality were significantly different for blue and crocodile sharks, with the males of both species having higher proportions of hooking mortality than the females. Specimen size was significant for predicting the hooking mortality for blue and shortfin mako sharks: in both cases, the larger specimens had lower odds of dying due to the fishing process. There were differences in the hooking mortality depending on the region of operation of the fleet, but those differences were also species-specific. For blue and crocodile sharks, the hooking mortality was higher in the Equatorial and southern Atlantic areas (when compared to the NE Atlantic region), while the opposite was observed for the shortfin mako, with lower mortality rates in the NE tropical area compared with the other regions. The results presented in this paper can be integrated into future ecological risk assessment analysis for pelagic elasmobranchs. Furthermore, the new information can be used to evaluate the impact of recent recommendations prohibiting the retention of some vulnerable elasmobranch species.

AB  - Since its origins in the mid-1970s, the slasher has been defined as a subgenre of horror in which a serial or mass killer stalks and massacres middle-class youngsters, and preferably attractive young women, using cutting weapons or projectiles. In that regard, the twenty-first century has seen a revival of the slasher, combining the release of original movies with remakes of classic films, adapting the traditional plots to the current context. In this paper, a comparative content analysis is performed on 13 slasher films made during the 1970s and the 1980s and 13 remakes premiered in the new millennium, focusing on the differences stemming from the adaptation of the latter to the new sociocultural context. The results indicate that, although there have been a number of changes, such as higher doses of explicit violence and profanity and in the fight responses of the victims, most of the subgenre's defining traits have remained intact, whereas others, such as those relating to the defining traits of the victims, should be questioned. The limited differences found between the original films and the remakes provide the basis for drawing interesting conclusions about the subgenre itself, as well as to raise discussions about the different contexts of production and reception.

AB  - The impact of volcanic activity and trophic state on the preservation of plant remains from two Triassic palaeolake deposits in western Gondwana is investigated. Six taphonomic modes are identified for the Potrerillos-Cacheuta sequence and the Los Rastros Formation, along with proposed taphonomic pathways for each mode. The taphonomic pathways were compared with those proposed for the Agua de la Zorra Formation, a coeval lacustrine-deltaic succession. In all three cases, plant preservation in off-shore lacustrine facies was enhanced by anoxic bottom conditions. In the more proximal near-shore facies, a high sedimentation rate would have been factor that enhanced the preservation. Variation in relative abundance and taxonomic diversity between the three successions are attributed to ecological differences rather than taphonomic differences among the lake systems. No evidence was recorded that the preserved plant material was produced by volcanic trauma. The preservation of the cuticle recorded in the Cacheuta Formation was likely enhanced by the apparently low thermal maturation of the rock and the presence of tuffaceous horizons. In the three successions, the abundance and distribution of remains throughout the sections suggest that the trophic state of the lake did not influence the preservation of the plant.

AB  - A combed cotton rotor-spun yarn of high quality was produced using customary industrial equipment. The yarn was warped, ensuring a conistent individual yarn tension. The warp set was uninterruptedly washed and cleaned in boiling water containing a mild detergent and a wetting agent, dried on a dummy slasher (i.e. without using any conventional sizing agent) to set the yarn twist torque, and wound onto a loom beam. A 2/1 twill fabric of a slightly open construction was successfully woven on a modified fly-shuttle loom, operating under normal speed and mill-like conditions. Although the yarn hairiness increased visibly as the warp raced forward towards the cloth fell, absolutely no fiber clinging or yarn snagging occurred and, for the first time ever, about 50 m of fabric was woven without a single warp yarn failure, which is very encouraging. This preliminary weaving trial indicates that weaving a singles cotton yarn without the traditional warp sizing may now indeed be feasible at least for certain types of yarns, fabrics and weaving machinery. Planned size-free weaving trials involving different types of fibers, yarns and modern weaving machinery are expected to determine the prospect and commercial scope of size-free weaving.

AB  - 'Meyer' zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steudel) is commonly planted on home lawns and golf courses in the transition zone; however, poor shade tolerance limits its widespread use. This study was conducted to determine changes and differences in growth among selected Zoysia cultivars and progeny under a natural shade environment over a 3-year period in the transition zone. The study was initiated in June 2010 at the Rocky Ford Turfgrass Research Center in Manhattan, KS. Soil type was a Chase silt loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic, Aquic, Argiudoll). Zoysia genotypes were sodded in 0.37-m(2) plots and arranged in a randomized complete block with five replications under silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) shade that resulted in a 91% reduction in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Genotypes included 'Zorro' [Z. matrella (L.) Merrill], 'Emerald' [Z. japonica x Z pacifica (Goudswaard) Hotta & Kuroki], 'Meyer', Chinese Common (Z. japonica), and experimental progeny Expl (Z. matrella x japonica), and Exp2 and Exp3 [(Z japonica X Z. pacifica) x Z japonica]. 'Zorro' and 'Emerald' experienced winter injury, which negatively affected their performance. Tiller numbers decreased 47% in 'Meyer' from June 2010 to June 2012, but declines in [(Z. japonica x Z pacifica) x Z japonica] progeny were only 1% for Exp2 and 27% for Exp3, and both Exp2 and Exp3 maintained high percent green cover throughout the study. In general, by the third year of evaluation, progeny of [(Z. japonica x Z. pacifica) x Z japonica] had higher quality ratings and higher tiller numbers than 'Meyer' and may provide more shade-tolerant cultivar choices for transition zone turf managers.

AB  - Factors influencing organic contaminant accumulation in sharks, especially across ontogeny, are not well-known. Contaminant concentrations were measured in three species of sharks (Blue, Shortfin Mako, and Common Thresher) across a range of size classes (neonatal to adult) that vary in their ecological and physiological characteristics. Empirical data was compared to a theoretical framework that predicted the shape of lifetime accumulation curves. We found that a one-size-fits-all accumulation model was not appropriate as species-specific characteristics had a significant effect on contaminant accumulation trajectories. Maternal offloading likely has an important effect on determining neonatal shark contaminant starting points, and trophic ecology and physiology may interact to affect the shape of species' contaminant accumulation curves. Makos were found to have the highest accumulation potential and Blues the lowest, with Threshers being intermediate in accumulation potential. Changes in species' ecology and/or physiology were also reflected in contaminant signature changes over ontogeny. If contaminant concentrations are to be used as a proxy for risk, species-specific characteristics need to be taken into account when estimating contaminant exposure and its potential negative effects on shark health and human consumption safety.

AB  - Get Out does not conform to the general expectations of horror films but instead plays with, inverts, and makes light of horror tropes. The slasher subgenre is a recognizable form that recurs in the public imaginary, but what we see in this film is repetition with a difference that reveals how recurring patterns can be reiterated in destabilizing ways. Here the "return of the repressed" is monstrous whiteness and white supremacy, which have been denied, or disavowed, in a "postracial" culture. When they return, they literally consume Black bodies, commandeering them for white use. Through this reading of Get Out, I intend to rethink the trope of the "Final Girl" as it is positioned within the slasher subgenre and to consider how that position not only provides context for current political moments but also shifts in the horror genre itself.

AB  - Winter-hardiness of zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) cultivars is an important attribute throughout the biogeographical transition zone; thus, the inability to withstand freezing temperatures may limit the use of these cultivars. The objective of this research was to determine the freeze tolerance (LT50) of nine zoysiagrass cultivars grown in Raleigh, NC. Four Zoysia japonica Steud. cultivars (JaMur, Palisades, Empire, and Ultimate) and five Zoysia matrella (L.) Merr. cultivars (Pristine, Zeon, Cavalier, Diamond, and Zorro) were chosen to undergo freeze testing. Cores were taken from the field in Feb. 2008, 2009, and 2010 for the winter trials and in Apr. 2008, 2009, and 2010 for the spring trials (after green-up had occurred). The cores were subjected to freeze treatments of -6,-8, 10,-12, and -14 degrees C in programmable freezers. After thawing, cores were placed in a 41/20 degrees C greenhouse to promote green-up. Cores were rated for green-up after 4 weeks on a 1 to 9 scale. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to calculate an LT50 value for each cultivar. 'JaMur', 'Palisades', 'Empire', and 'Ultimate' were no different in the winter trials with an LT50 ranging from -9.8 to 10.2 degrees C. Among the matrella species, `Zeon', 'Cavalier', and 'Zorro' were no different but 'Diamond' (LT50 of -6.0 degrees C) and 'Pristine' (LT50 of -5.7 degrees C) had less tolerance to freezing than the other matrella cultivars (LT50 range from -9.7 to 9.8), suggesting lower ability to cold-acclimate in the field than the other cultivars. Shoot weights of cores were correlated to visual green-up ratings for each cultivar with an le range from 0.70 to 0.99 indicating a good relationship between the green-up ratings and shoot weights.

AB  - Using 3 years of observations with the Zorro and 'Alopeke speckle interferometric instruments at Gemini South and North, respectively, we present an analysis of the sensitivity of the data taken in two narrow-band optical filters centered at 562 and 832 nm (widths of 54 and 40 nm, respectively). In this paper we focus on model calculations of the predicted signal-to-noise values achievable and the results of over 2500 actual observations. We find that S/N values of several 100 are easily achieved, but that the sky background during full moon is a very limiting factor in the observations, especially those performed in the short-wavelength (blue) optical spectral range and for targets fainter than R = 14. A comparison of our Gemini speckle observations over six observing semesters reveals that red band-pass observations provide more robust results in general, likely due to better atmospheric performance at these wavelengths. Using the identical instruments on Gemini North and South, we find that similar results are obtained, yielding typical contrast limits of 5-9 magnitudes from the diffraction limit out to 1.2? for a range of target brightness (optical magnitudes from =3 to > 16 ). Using our S/N model along with the observational results, an estimation of the contrast limits achievable for a given observation can be predicted based on the target brightness, sky illumination and seeing conditions, and the total integration time.

AB  - The given article reviews and analyzes noise sources in a combine harvester "RSM ACROS-550". The results of measurements of noise levels at the entrance to the cabin are provided. The necessity of developing a set of measures to improve the acoustic background of the considered class of machinery has been justified. The main sources of noise formation and contribution of each of them to the general level of sound pressure are determined with the help of qualitative and quantitative analysis. A simulation and analytical model of air flow distribution in the working area of the threshing block has been developed using the computer simulation software of gas flow dynamics "SolidWorks Flow Simulation". The complex nature of the interaction and the gas flow multidirectional trajectories while passing the rasp bars of a thresher drum through the concave zone has been revealed. It has been established that the complex air flow speed rates in some areas reach a high subsonic level, and the existing thrasher construction contains a number of acoustically active elements that causes air noise generation. On the basis of the received results the methods to improve the general acoustic background of the considered class of vehicles have been formulated.

AB  - The place of Jang Chul-soo (Chang Ch'ol-su)'s Bedeviled (Kim Pong-nain sarinsakon ui chonmal, 2010) in the cycle of recent South Korean revenge films hailed for their pairing of poetic visuals and "extreme" violence seems rather straightforward, yet this article argues for Bedevilleds singularity, as a work that critiques the gender politics of transnational genre cinemas like the slasher-horror and rape-revenge film, and the Korean literary and film genres that also serve as its important intertexts. This article examines the multiple modes by which Bedeviled interrupts the use of the revenge trope as a depoliticizing, privatizing system of generic representation through its citation of colonial period naturalist writer Kim Tong-in's well known short stories "Potatoes" ("Kamja," 1925) and "The Seaman's Chant" ("Paettaragi," 1921) and Kamja, the 1987 film adaptation of the same story directed by Byun Jang-ho (Pyon Chang-ho) and starring Kang Su-yeon (Kang Su-yon), amid its visualization of the slasher genre's complex gender dynamics. Analyzing Bedevilleds trans-media adaptation of two of Kim's best known works of short fiction and a key example of the 1980s genre cycle of t'osok ero yonghwa (Nativist erotic film), I chart the film's ironic repetition of the earlier works' visual and narrative tropes, particularly in the film's disturbing presentation of patriarchal oppression as a pervasive social disease. By embedding tales that attribute characters' fates to their social environments within the anti-heroic conventions of the revenge narrative, Bedeviled mobilizes two incommensurable genre frameworks to reorient the drive of social critique towards alternative modes of collective identification rather than those based in nationalism or subordination to patriarchy's psycho-sexual violence. Moreover, the film's juxtaposition of unexpected genre frameworks becomes the basis for its gendered critique of Kim's literary legacy, the cinematic repertoire of male fantasy in 1980s literary films, and contemporary conventions of institutionalized misogyny.

AB  - Fisheries targeting elasmobranch resources have experienced a dramatic growth during the past two decades. World-wide elasmobranch landings exceed 600 000 metric tons (mt) annually and have clearly made a significant impact on portions of that resource. In the eastern north Pacific catches of common thresher, shortfin mako and blue sharks may exceed 15 000 mt annually. Nearly 90% of all sharks taken within this area are immature. Like most sharks, these pelagics have low rates of increase which make them quite vulnerable to modem day fishing pressure. Clearly the removal of large segments of juveniles from any population has the potential to decrease the adult population to unsustainable levels. The ability of populations to recover from over-exploitation depends not only on initial stock size, natural mortality, and migration rates, but also upon reducing total fishing mortality. Regulations enacted by special interest groups benefiting only one segment of the resource users, combined with the lack of biological information, have slowed progress towards achieving rational management.

AB  - This paper presents the palynofacies analysis results from La Cascadita locality of Playa del Zorro Alloformation (late Miocene-Pliocene), being the first palynological study of the Neogene outcrops of the Cajon Valley, northwestern Argentina. Eleven palynological and organic matter samples were analyzed, only three of them containing palynomorphs (spores of Glomus sp. and Lycoperdon sp., Chlorophyta algae colonies, spores Zygnemataceae and few angiosperm pollen grains). Four types of organic matter were identified: phytoclasts (translucent and opaque), palynomorphs, amorphous organic matter and zooclasts. Given the overall frequency of these types and relative frequencies of the particles that constitute them, two palynofacies can be distinguished. The Palynofacies Type I is characterized by the relatively high frequency semi-opaque and equidimensional opaque phytoclasts, reduced organic amorphous matter and low representativeness of palynomorphs; suggesting oxidizing environments, poor transport and high-energy environment. The Palynofacies Type II is characterized by high relative frequency of palynomorphs and amorphous organic, and have the lower values of phytoclasts, which suggests an environment with more reducing conditions than those of the Palynofacies I, temporarily anoxic and shallow. The climate regime would have been warm, semi-arid with a marked dry seasonality.

AB  - Some 180 species of marine fish were reported from Ghana in F. R. Irvine's The Fishes and Fisheries of the Gold Coast , an important milestone in West African ichthyology published in 1947. Although the book has been a major source of records for subsequent workers, the underpinning collections have been largely ignored. Two hundred and ninety-two specimens from 139 species collected by Irvine and colleagues were located within The Natural History Museum collections and are reported here with notes on their zoogeography. These were re-identified in the light of the intervening half century of research and have allowed us to examine the basis for most of Irvine's records by matching Irvine's collection numbers (referred to in his book) to BMNH registration numbers. In addition to registered material some 26 jars of unregistered material containing 46 specimens were discovered. About 20% of the species were found to have been misidentified. Six of the marine species collected by Irvine were described by J. R. Norman as new species between 1930 and 1935. These remain valid as: Rhinobatos albomaculatus Norman, 1930; Rhinobatos irvinei Norman, 1931; Serranus accraensis (Norman, 1931); Spicara nigricauda (Norman, 1931); Branchiostegus semifasciatus (Norman, 1931) and Pontinus accraensis Norman, 1935. A further nine species collected by Irvine were at the time unknown to science and have since been described by others as new species. Of particular interest is a specimen of Panturichthys isognathus Poll, 1953 which appears to be only the second adult specimen reported. Most of the 39 species for which material could not be located represented uncontentious records. However, there were eight species listed by Irvine, for which no voucher specimens could be located, which are unlikely to occur off Ghana, and a further two species ( Carcharodon carcharias and Alopias vulpinus ) for which Irvine's records cannot be considered a basis for a Ghana record. Five species ( Conger conger, Umbrina cirrosa, Scorpaena scrofa, Chaetodon striatus and Liza ramada ) are considered as doubtful records based on misidentifications. Three other species ( Dentex macrophthalmus, Sphyrna zygaena and S. tudes ) appear unlikely records for Ghana but cannot be totally dismissed. Inter alia this study demonstrates the critical importance of voucher specimens in museum collections to support biodiversity research.

AB  - Hunting billbugs (Sphenophorus venatus vestitus Chittenden) cause damage to zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) and bermudagrass (Cynodon spp), which is often misdiagnosed as the effects of drought, disease, or another soil insect. Populations have increased over the past several decades and are causing extensive damage on grasses in lawns, golf courses and other landscapes. Nine cultivars of Zoysia were evaluated for resistance to S. venatus vestitus in a field cage choice test in a paired cage split-plot experiment. Leaf-firing of plant canopy was considered an above ground expression of root feeding damage by billbug larvae. 'Diamond' and 'Zorro' exhibited significantly less leaf firing damage (a reduction of 6.1 and 9.8%, respectively). In contrast, 'Palisades', 'Meyer', and 'Crowne' showed >40% canopy damage. When root, shoot, and total plant dry weights were compared, 'Diamond', 'Zorro', 'Cavalier', and 'Royal' [all Z. matrella (L.) Merr.] sustained less dry weight reduction (<53%) than 'Palisades', 'Meyer', and 'El Toro' (all Z. japonica Steud.) with 76, 74, and 70% total dry weight reductions, respectively. Cultivars of Z matrella appear to be more resistant as a group than the Z. japonica cultivars.

KW  - interpretability
AB  - With the ever-increasing popularity and applications of graph neural networks, several proposals have been made to explain and understand the decisions of a graph neural network. Explanations for graph neural networks differ in principle from other input settings. It is important to attribute the decision to input features and other related instances connected by the graph structure. We find that the previous explanation generation approaches that maximize the mutual information between the label distribution produced by the model and the explanation to be restrictive. Specifically, existing approaches do not enforce explanations to be valid, sparse, or robust to input perturbations. In this paper, we lay down some of the fundamental principles that an explanation method for graph neural networks should follow and introduce a metric RDT-Fidelity as a measure of the explanation's effectiveness. We propose a novel approach Zorro based on the principles from rate-distortion theory that uses a simple combinatorial procedure to optimize for RDT-Fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets reveal that Zorro produces sparser, stable, and more faithful explanations than existing graph neural network explanation approaches.

T2  - AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
LA  - English
AB  - The soil fertility changes due to insitu incorporation of cotton stalks and residual effect of crop residue management was investigated through a field experimental with post harvest stalks as standing crop. The treatments included operation with roto slasher followed by disc plough, operation of roto slasher followed by rotovator, operation of disc plough followed by rotovator and hand pulling of cotton stalks followed by disc ploughing and cultivator once. Tillage treatments were imposed as non-replicated and succeeding cowpea crop (Co.4) was raised in RBD with two replications. Pre- and post-experimental soil sampling was done using core sampler and were analyzed for physical properties such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and total porosity at different soil depths, viz. 0-15, 15-30 and 30-45 cm. The chemical properties such as pH, EC, macro and micro nutrients were also analyzed at periodical intervals, viz. 10, 20 and 30 days after incorporation. Subsequently, the residual crop was sown and maintained till maturity. Treatments with a disc plough played a predominant role in lowering the bulk density and increasing the hydraulic conductivity and porosity. The residual effect observed showed that the pod and haulm yields of cowpea were maximum (10.38 and 55.2 q ha(-1), respectively) under roto slasher followed by disc plough (T-1). There was 21.6 percent increase in pod yield compared to farmers' practice. This was followed by disc plough followed by rotovator tilling (T-3). Farmers' practice (T-4) recorded the lowest pod and haulm yield (8.53 and 45.4 q ha(-1) respectively) due to non-incorporation of cotton stalks. Roto slashing of post-harvest cotton stubbles followed by incorporation through disc ploughing once was the best as it recorded the favourable soil physical and chemical properties and recorded the maximum pod and haulm yield of the succeeding cowpea crop, suggesting its suitability for crop residue management for sustainable crop production.

AB  - A thresher shark poached by fishermen in the stretch of sea between the island of Ponza and the coast of Terracina (Lazio, Central Italy, Mediterranean Sea) and confiscated by the Italian health authorities was evaluated for the presence of chemical contaminants. Hg mean concentration of 2.1 mg kg- 1 was found in muscle; speciation analysis confirmed it was almost in the toxic organic form of MeHg (2.0 mg kg-1). The Se:Hg molar ratio was <1 not protective against the toxic effect of Hg. 137Cs was detected at a mean concentration of 0.53 Bq kg-1, and 40K, radioisotope of natural origin was found at 91 Bq kg- 1. Dioxins and PCBs were found in the common thresher shark at mean concentrations of 0.012 and 0.088 pg TEQ-WHO g-1 w.w. while NDL PCBs at 4.5 ng g-1 w.w., lower than limits set by European Regulation. The major concern is constituted by the presence of Hg twice the maximum limit set by EU Regulation, then the consumption of thresher shark flesh should be strongly discouraged.

AB  - This study aimed to add a nuanced understanding of how viewing different subgenres of paranormal horror can cultivate beliefs in the paranormal. I collected cross-sectional survey data among 601 adults aged 18-56 (M = 24.06, SD = 4.16), with a relatively even gender distribution (40.6% males, 59.4% females). Using a linear regression model, I found that more frequent exposure to paranormal horror was related to paranormal beliefs, but only if the paranormal horror subgenre claimed to depict reality (i.e., based on true events reenactments and paranormal reality TV). Neither paranormal subgenres that did not include a truth claim (e.g., found footage) nor nonparanormal horror subgenres (e.g., slasher) were related to paranormal beliefs. I conclude that it is possible that truth claims lead viewers to process the depicted events as fact, instead of fiction, thus resulting in a shift in real-world beliefs. However, considering the cross-cultural nature of the data, it is also possible that those who already believe in the paranormal are more likely to seek out this content.

AB  - Two new imaging instruments, 'Alopeke and Zorro, were designed, built, and commissioned at the Gemini-North and Gemini-South telescopes in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Here we describe them and present the results from over a year of operation. The two identical instruments are based on the legacy of the DSSI (Differential Speckle Survey Instrument) instrument, successfully used for years at the WIYN and the Gemini telescopes in Hawaii and Chile. 'Alopeke and Zorro are dual-channel imagers having both speckle (6.7 '') and "wide-field" (similar to 1 arcminute) field-of-view options. They were built to primarily perform speckle interferometry providing diffraction-limited imagery at optical wavebands, yielding pixel scale uncertainties of +/- 0.21 mas, position angle uncertainties of +/- 0.7(degrees), and photometric uncertainties of Delta m +/- 0.02-0.04 magnitudes (for the blue and red channels, respectively) when run through the standard data reduction pipeline. One of their main scientific roles is the validation and characterization of exoplanets and their host stars as discovered by transit surveys such as the NASA Kepler, K2, and TESS missions. The limiting magnitude for speckle observations at Gemini can be quite faint (r similar to 18 in good observing conditions) but typically the observed targets are brighter. The instruments can also function as conventional CCD imagers providing a 1 arc-minute field of view and allowing simultaneous two-color, high-speed time-series operation. These resident visitor instruments are remotely operable and are available for use by the community via the peer-reviewed proposal process.

AB  - Predator-prey dynamics represent an important determinant in the functioning of marine ecosystems. This study provides the first quantitative investigation of the diets of sympatric pelagic shark species in gulf and shelf waters off southern Australia. Stomachs of 417 sharks collected from fishery catches between 2007 and 2011 were examined, including 250 bronze whalers, 52 shortfin makos, 49 dusky sharks, 39 smooth hammerheads, and 27 common threshers. Dusky sharks had the highest dietary diversity of the five species examined. We found overlap in the consumption of cephalopods, small pelagic teleosts, crustaceans, and benthic teleosts in bronze whalers, dusky sharks, and smooth hammerheads, and preliminary evidence of specialization in the highly migratory species, the common thresher and the shortfin mako. Findings were discussed and compared with previous studies in other temperate marine ecosystems. This study will significantly improve the understanding of the ecological roles of these top predators in the gulf and shelf habitats off southern Australia, and enhance the ecosystem models being developed for this unique bioregion.

AB  - Shade is a major problem facing turf managers worldwide. Availability of low-cost devices and methods for quantifying daily light integral (DLI) offer the turf manager the ability to more precisely determine DLI levels in shade, yet minimal DLI requirements for acceptable turf quality (DLIm) for many commonly used warm-season turf cultivars grown under longer-term chronic shade stress have not been extensively tested. The objectives of this 2-yr field shade study were to (a) determine effects of growth regulator trinexapac-ethyl (TE) and season (summer or fall) on DLIm of nine commercially available bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) and zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) cultivars; (b) determine effects of shade level and TE on summer percent green cover and root growth; and (c) determine effects of shade treatments on soil temperatures across the growing season. Significantly higher DLIm were noted during summer compared to fall for all cultivars in the study. The DLIm were generally higher for bermudagrass than zoysiagrass cultivars. 'Tifway' required the highest DLIm (ranging from 23.5 to 27.2 mol m(-2) d(-1)) of the bermudagrasses. 'TifGrand', 'Celebration', and 'Latitude 36' showed comparable DLIm during summer and fall. Fewer consistent differences were detected between zoysiagrasses, with 'Zorro' and 'Zeon' showing the lowest summer DLIm (18.1 and 19.1 mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively) and 'Geo' showing the lowest fall DLIm (11.7 mol m(-2) d(-1)). Trinexapac-ethyl reduced DLIm only in Zorro, 'Palisades', and 'JaMur' zoysiagrass, but had no effect on bermudagrass DLIm. The DLIm for a number of cultivars were higher than those previously reported in the literature, which may be attributed to lower mowing heights and/or use of permanent shade structures that were not removed for the duration of the 27-mo study. The findings should benefit turf managers by guiding data-driven, seasonal-based, warm-season turfgrass cultivar selection for shaded environments.

AB  - A neotectonic study at the transitional segment between the Central and North Patagonian Andes, in the northern part of the Neuquen province in Argentina (37 degrees-38 degrees S) was carried out revisiting sites previously surveyed and addressing new field evidence from a morphotectonic perspective. Particularly, fieldwork in the Guanacos fold and thrust belt (GFTB) highlighted that the inner retroarc region at these latitudes has been dominated, almost exclusively, by a Quaternary compressive regime, contrarily to previous proposals that favored a strike-slip regime. The main structures affect upper Pliocene Cola de Zorro Formation and younger deposits, developing scarps up to 60 m in height. Numerical models were performed to simulate Guanacos fault activity and to test the reliability of the scarps and deformed strata as deformation markers. From these models, shortening rates of 0.04-0.06 mm/yr were calculated. In addition, new evidence of normal faulting in Pliocene rocks was revealed. In a more regional frame, we revised two models that introduced and explained the dextral faulting in this segment of the Andes during the Quaternary, which is well constrained by focal mechanisms at the arc zone. Even though seismological data reveal strike-slip deformation along the arc, our findings suggest that at the same latitudes in the inner retroarc zone, immediately to the east, strain partitioning is negligible and, although with low deformation rates, all this transitional region between the Central and North Patagonian Andes is affected by Quaternary compressional stresses controlling surface deformation. A major crustal boundary, i.e. the Arauco transition zone, might be exerting a first-order control in this particular stress-strain distribution.

AB  - Design of SP networks in which the non-linear layer is applied to only a part of the state in each round was suggested by Gerard et al. at CHES 2013. Besides performance advantage on certain platforms, such a design allows for more efficient masking techniques that can mitigate side-channel attacks with a small performance overhead.
   In this paper we present generic techniques for differential and linear cryptanalysis of SP networks with partial non-linear layers, including an automated characteristic search tool and dedicated key-recovery algorithms. Our techniques can be used both for cryptanalysis of such schemes and for proving their security with respect to basic differential and linear cryptanalysis, succeeding where previous automated analysis tools seem to fail.
   We first apply our techniques to the block cipher Zorro (designed by Gerard et al. following their methodology), obtaining practical attacks on the cipher which where fully simulated on a single desktop PC in a few days. Then, we propose a mild change to Zorro, and formally prove its security against basic differential and linear cryptanalysis. We conclude that there is no inherent flaw in the design strategy of Gerard et al., and it can be used in future designs, where our tools should prove useful.

AB  - Divots created by a golf stroke are a natural occurrence on golf courses and the resistance of turf to divot injury is an important factor that should be considered when selecting a turfgrass. Therefore, the primary objective of this experiment was to quantify the divot resistance for various bermudagrass (Cynodon spp. Rich.) and zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp. Willd.) cultivars in a field experiment, with a secondary objective to compare evaluation methods for quantifying divot resistance. This study was conducted in Fayetteville, AR. Divot type, severity, and volume as well as a Turfgrass Shear Tester were used to determine divot resistance. 'Riviera' bermudagrass had the largest volume per divot (70 cm(3)), while the smallest divots (< 28 cm(3)) were observed with 'Cavalier', 'Diamond', and 'Zorro' zoysiagrass. More force was required to displace divots from Diamond zoysiagrass than from Riviera, 'Patriot', or 'Princess 77' bermduagrass. Zoysia matrella (L.) Merr. consistently demonstrated greater divot resistance than Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. The four methods for evaluating divot resistance provided similar findings for divot resistance for the cultivars and species tested. These results provide researchers methods for evaluating divot resistance and will allow golf course superintendents to better select cultivars and species that will improve playing conditions and reduce divot injury.

AB  - We present a validation of a long-period (91.68278 (+0.00032)(-0.00041) days) transiting sub-Neptune planet, TOI-1221 b (TIC 349095149.01), around a Sun-like (m(V)= 10.5) star. This is one of the few known exoplanets with a period >50 days, and belongs to the even smaller subset of which have bright enough hosts for detailed spectroscopic follow-up. We combine Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curves and ground-based time-series photometry from the Perth Exoplanet Survey Telescope (0.3m) and Las Cumbres Observatory global telescope network (1.0m) to analyze the transit signals and rule out nearby stars as potential false-positive sources. High-contrast imaging from the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope and Gemini/Zorro rule out nearby stellar contaminants. Reconnaissance spectroscopy from CHIRON sets a planetary scale upper mass limit on the transiting object (1.1 and 3.5 M-Jup at 1 sigma and 3 sigma, respectively) and shows no sign of a spectroscopic binary companion. We determine a planetary radius of R-p 2.91 (+0.13)(-0.12) R-circle plus, placing it in the sub-Neptune regime. With a stellar insolation of S 6.06 (-0.77) (+0.85) S-circle plus, we calculate a moderate equilibrium temperature of T-eq= 440 K, assuming no albedo and perfect heat redistribution. We find a falsepositive probability from the TRICERATOPS tool of FPP= 0.0014 +/- 0.0003 as well as other qualitative and quantitative evidence to support the statistical validation of TOI-1221 b. We find significant evidence (>5 sigma) of oscillatory transit timing variations, likely indicative of an additional nontransiting planet.

AB  - Partially gelatinized corn starch (PGCS) was used for sizing cotton yarn in the search for potential sustainable and environmentally friendly warp-sizing agents as substitutes for poly vinyl alcohol. PGCS was prepared by a constant temperature method (CTM). The viscosity stability of PGCS was investigated and characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, polarized light microscopy and laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The results indicated that the viscosity of CTM65 (starch milk held in a water bath shaker at 65 degrees C for 30 min) was stable. The cotton yarn was sized by PGCS (CTM65) on a cylinder slasher sizing machine. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that starch granules on the surface of the yarn had completely gelatinized and formed a film when the yarn was treated via the No. 2 drying cylinder (to reduce yarn hairiness). This research supports the idea that PGCS could improve the viscosity stability of native starch paste and have potential as an environmentally friendly warp-sizing agent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is a need to better understand the survivorship of discarded fishes, both for commercial stocks and species of conservation concern. Within European waters, the landing obligations that are currently being phased in as part of the European Union's reformed common fisheries policy means that an increasing number of fish stocks, with certain exceptions, should not be discarded unless it can be demonstrated that there is a high probability of survival. This study reviews the various approaches that have been used to examine the discard survival of elasmobranchs, both in terms of at-vessel mortality (AVM) and post-release mortality (PRM), with relevant findings summarized for both the main types of fishing gear used and by taxonomic group. Discard survival varies with a range of biological attributes (species, size, sex and mode of gill ventilation) as well as the range of factors associated with capture (e.g. gear type, soak time, catch mass and composition, handling practices and the degree of exposure to air and any associated change in ambient temperature). In general, demersal species with buccal-pump ventilation have a higher survival than obligate ram ventilators. Several studies have indicated that females may have a higher survival than males. Certain taxa (including hammerhead sharks Sphyrna spp. and thresher sharks Alopias spp.) may be particularly prone to higher rates of mortality when caught. (C) 2016 Crown copyright

After field evaluations in Dallas, TX (2004-2009) and Gainesville, FL (2006-2008), DALZ 1308 was selected for advancement to the 2013 Warm-season Putting Greens National Turfgrass Evaluation Program (NTEP). DALZ 1308 was evaluated at 10 NTEP locations (2013-2018) as well as in Dallas, TX (2014-2017) and Gainesville, FL (2013-2017). DALZ 1308 exhibited a diminutive growth habit with narrower and shorter leaf blades and dwarf canopy height as compared to Diamond and L1F; shorter internode length, smaller node, and smaller internode diameter as compared to L1F; superior ball roll as compared to Diamond and L1F in Arizona, Kentucky, and Texas; resistance to tawny mole crickets; and reduced seedhead incidence and density during the growing season. As compared to Diamond and L1F, DALZ 1308 has shown to have reduced winter injury with fabric cover in Bloomington, IN. Although characteristics varied by location, DALZ 1308 exhibits good turfgrass quality, high shoot density, medium-green genetic color, and extended fall and winter color retention. Initial greenhouse experimentation under moderate shade shows that DALZ 1308 has a greater percent green cover as compared to 'Palisades', Diamond, and 'Zorro'. Overall, DALZ , 1308 is an ultradwarf zoysiagrass suitable for golf course putting greens in a wide range of environments across the United States.

AB  - Introduction In recent years, data collected by the French Addictovigilance Network have shown the potential for abuse and addiction associated with zolpidem (the most sold hypnotic drug in France). Since 10 April 2017, new regulations have come into force that require zolpidem to be prescribed on special secure prescription pads, in order to reduce the risk of abuse or misuse. This measure has far-reaching repercussions that are not only limited to the consumption of zolpidem but also extend to the usage of sedative medication on a whole. The objective of the ZOlpidern and the Reinforcement of the Regulation of prescription Orders (ZORRO) study is to evaluate the overall impact of the new regulatory framework requiring zolpidem to be prescribed on special secure prescription pads. Three axes will be evaluated: the number of consumers, the type of consumption (chronic use versus occasional use, problematic consumption versus non problematic use) and the consumption of other sedative molecules.The study has been registered in the Protocol Registration and Results System under the number NCT03584542 at stage "Pre-results".
   Methods and analysis The ZORRO study is an epidemiological, observational, national multicentre, non-controlled, prospective research project supported by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety. The evaluation of the impact of the regulatory framework change relative to zolpidem will be done according to two axes: via an epidemiological study of the French National Health Insurance database and by the implementation of field studies of prescribers and consumers of zolpidem.
   Ethics and dissemination The Nantes Research Ethics Committee (Groupe Nantais d'Ethique dans le Domaine de la Sante), the Committee for the Protection of the Population and the Committee of Expertise in Research, Studies and Evaluations in the Field of Health approved this study. Results will be presented in national and international conferences and submitted to peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - This study documented the parasite faunas of the spiral valves of blue sharksPrionace glauca(L. 1758) and common thresher sharksAlopias vulpinus(Bonnaterre, 1788) caught in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) north of the Mexican border. The spiral valves of 18 blue and 19 thresher sharks caught in the CCLME from 2009 to 2013 were examined for parasites. Seven parasite taxa were found in blue sharks and nine in threshers. The tetraphyllidean cestodeAnthobothriumsp. (78% prevalence) was the most common parasite in blue sharks, and the phyllobothriid cestodeParaorygmatobothriumsp. (90% prevalence) was the most common in threshers. An adult nematode of the genusPiscicapillariawas found in threshers for the first time and may be a new species. Adult individuals ofHysterothylaciumsp. were found in both shark species. The adult acanthocephalanRhadinorhynchus cololabisand remains of the parasitic copepodPennellasp. - both parasites of Pacific saury,Cololabis saira- were found in the intestines of threshers, indicating recent feeding on saury. This study paves the way for a more comprehensive examination, including more samples and a wider variety of shark species, to provide a greater understanding of shark feeding behaviour and possibly provide information on shark population biology.

AB  - In Cynara cardunculus L. var. altilis different researches have shown the grain production and its chemical characterization, resulting in about 240 and 230 g kg(-1) DM of oil and protein content, making the grain potentially useful for different utilizations. The oil fatty acid profile is similar to sunflower one, making this crop usable for human consumption. The oil contains also high levels of alpha-tocopherol, which offers stability against oxidation. Moreover, genotypes characterized by high acid oleic content, useful for biodiesel production, are in selection. In the last years the interest in antioxidant biocompounds source from agricultural wastes or from grains after extraction of oil is growing. In this work data concerning chemical characterization for antioxidant compounds of the whole seed and its partitioning is explored using achenes of Cynara cardunculus var. altilis Line 01-2011. Heads were threshed with a specific mini thresher to separate grains (achenes), which were then weighed to determine 1000 seed weight. Some seeds were utilized to obtain hull (H) and kernel (K), some others were analysed in whole (W). The incidence of hull on the whole seed was determined. On each part of the achenes the moisture content was measured. Grain lipid substances were extracted and quantified by the Soxhlet method. After oil extraction, the phenolic acids characterization (chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, catechin), was performed by uHPLC-Dionex in H, K and W, separately. Results showed that about 45% of whole seed was hull. Differences in oil amount between kernel and whole seed were recorded, resulting more concentrated in K (398 g kg(-1) DM) than W (226 g kg(-1) DM). The hull resulted rich in phenolics (as sum of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, catechin), which can be recovered after oil extraction with a content higher than 5,000 mg kg(-1) DM.

AB  - Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) acquires nitrogen (N) from the atmosphere through symbiotic N fixation (SNF) but is considered a poor N fixer. Diversity for SNF within dry bean germplasm is recognized, and regions of the genome associated with SNF traits have recently been identified. In the current study a mapping population of 122 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), derived from the cross of two black bean cultivars (' Puebla 152 ' and ' Zorro ') contrasting in SNF traits, was grown in the field in East Lansing, MI, and Isabela, Puerto Rico, and in the greenhouse under N-free conditions to evaluate for yield, nodule development, biomass growth, agronomic traits, and N fixation. The RIL population was also genotyped with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers developed through the BeanCAP to construct a genetic map spanning 972 cM and containing 430 SNPs. A total of 17 unique QTL associated with SNF traits were identified with most of them located in three large clusters on Pv01 (4), Pv06 (6), and Pv08 (6). Many of the QTL associated with %N derived from atmosphere, N harvest index, and % N in biomass were also associated with candidate genes expressed in the nodules and roots. The majority of QTL associated with genes expressed in the root or nodule were derived from Puebla 152, while QTL associated with genes with enhanced expression in stems and pods were associated with Zorro. The QTL described should serve as potential targets for improvement of SNF characteristics in commercial dry bean genotypes adapted to temperate zones.

AB  - Field studies were conducted in 2010 and 2011 at two locations in Michigan to examine the effect of row width and herbicide combination on weed suppression and yield in the new Type II black bean variety `Zorro.' Black bean was planted in 38- and 76-cm rows. Six weed control strategies were examined: S-metolachlor + halosulfuron (PRE), S-metolachlor (PRE) followed by (fb) bentazon + fomesafen (POST), halosulfuron (PRE) fb clethodim (+ fomesafen at one site in one year) (POST), imazamox + bentazon (POST), a weed-free control, and a nontreated control. Weed control and crop injury were evaluated throughout the growing season. In addition, weeds were counted by species in late July, and weed biomass was harvested and weighed at the end of the season. Black bean yield was obtained by direct harvest. Narrow rows reduced weed populations in two of the four site-year combinations (referred to hereafter as site years), reduced weed biomass in three of the four site years, and often improved control of upright broadleaf weeds. All herbicide combinations generally reduced weed populations and biomass, but control of specific weeds was variable. Crop injury was generally slight and transient. Yield was greater in narrow rows in two of the four site-years. All herbicide combinations increased yield compared with the nontreated control and resulted in similar yields to one another. Yield and weed suppression was often maximized in narrow rows, while herbicide performance varied by year and weed spectrum.

AB  - Purpose Revegetation of riparian zones is important to improve their soil nitrogen (N) dynamics and to preserve their microbial compositions. However, the success of revegetation projects currently depends on weed control to reduce non-target vegetation competing over nutrients and to ensure the target plant species growth and survival. Different weed control methods affect soil microbial composition and N cycling. However, the long-term effects of herbicides on soil nitrogen (N) pools and microbial community composition remain uncertain even after cessation of the herbicide application.
   Materials and methods This study compared the impacts of different herbicides (Roundup((R)), BioWeed (TM), Slasher((R)), and acetic acid) with mulch on soil N dynamics and microbial community structure 3 years after vegetation establishment (herbicides applied repeatedly in the first 2 years after which no herbicides were applied in the third final year).
   Results and discussion Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was significantly higher in mulch compared with Roundup((R)), BioWeed (TM), Slasher((R)), and acetic acid at month 26 at the Kandanga site and month 10 at the Pinbarren site. Soil MBC remained significantly higher in mulch compared with Roundup((R)) and BioWeed (TM), 12 months after the cessation of herbicide application at the Pinbarren site. Soil MBC in the Roundup((R)) and BioWeed (TM) groups was also lower than the acceptable threshold (160 mg kg(-1)) at month 34 at the Pinbarren site. Soil NO3--N was significantly higher in the mulch than the Roundup((R)) at months 22 and 34 after revegetation at the Pinbarren site which could be partly explained by the decreased abundance of the denitrifying bacteria (Candidatus solibacter and C. koribacter). Additionally, both soil bacterial and fungal communities at the Pinbarren site and only fungal community at the Kandanga site were different in the mulch group compared with all other herbicides. The differences persisted 12 months after the cessation of herbicide application at the Pinbarren site.
   Conclusion Our study suggested that the application of mulch to assist with riparian revegetation would be beneficial for soil microbial functionality. The use of herbicides may have long-lasting effects on soil microbial biomass and diversity and therefore herbicides should be used with caution as part of an integrated land management plan.

AB  - In an effort to improve sailor safety during underway replenishment on the open sea, a robotic refueling system has been developed to autonomously refuel unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer (RAFT) project has demonstrated a methodology that could be used on the open water to autonomously refuel Navy vessels at significant sea states. The prototype refueling system is made up of two robotic arms: a rigid and precise industrial robotic manipulator to pinpoint the location of the target fuel tank and a novel soft pneumatic arm (Octarm) to provide compliant and safe contact with the USV. At the end of the Octarm, a magnetic end effector was designed (patent pending) to transfer a refueling "puck" from the robotic system to the target fuel tank. Acting under manual control or autonomously through visual tracking techniques, the robotic refueling system was shown to effectively transfer fuel to the target US Navy Sea Fox vessel under sea state 3.25 conditions at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using a robotic solution to allow autonomous shore-to-ship or ship-to-USV refueling. It also illustrates the benefits and challenges of future robotic ship-to-USV refueling operations. This represents the first demonstrated use of a robotic system for fluid transfer to vessels in active sea states. This paper describes the design, development, and demonstration of the prototype autonomous refueling system.

It centers on dialogue conducted with Indigenous women from Northern Baja California (Arcelia, the cultural healer from the Kumiai community of San Jose de la Zorra), Oaxaca (Maria Sabina through textual analysis of the only book that houses her healing wisdom), and Chiapas (the Lacandon community of Lacanja Chansayab). It then highlights ways in which the author-an academic woman-brought the wisdom of Indigenous cultures to the center of academic discourse, and how Indigenous women apply their knowledge and wisdom to heal their communities. Lastly, the article concludes with lessons learned from the dialogues with Indigenous women, how they have applied innovative research and healing strategies that depart from Euro-American paradigms, and how they creatively contribute to the development of Indigenous psychologies that are anchored in feminist, popular power.

AB  - We present orbital elements, orbital parallaxes, and individual component masses for 14 spatially resolved double-line spectroscopic binaries derived doing a simultaneous fit of their visual orbit and radial velocity curve. This was done by means of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code developed by our group that produces posterior distribution functions and error estimates for all of the parameters. Of this sample, six systems had high-quality previous studies and were included as benchmarks to test our procedures, but even in these cases, we could improve the previous orbits by adding recent data from our survey of southern binaries being carried out with the HRCam and ZORRO speckle cameras at the SOAR 4.1 m and Gemini South 8.1 m telescopes, respectively. We also give results for eight objects that did not have a published combined orbital solution, one of which did not have a visual orbit either. We could determine mass ratios with a typical uncertainty of less than 1%, mass sums with uncertainties of about 1%, and individual component masses with a formal uncertainty of 0.01 M (circle dot) in the best cases. A comparison of our orbital parallaxes with available trigonometric parallaxes from Hipparcos and Gaia eDR3 shows a good correspondence, the mean value of the differences being consistent with zero within the errors of both catalogs. We also present observational H-R diagrams for our sample of binaries, which, in combination with isochrones from different sources, allowed us to assess their evolutionary status and the quality of their photometry.

TI  - Creation Myth: The Imagining of the Gothic Imagination in the Diodati Triptych: <i>Gothic</i> (1986), <i>Haunted Summer</i> (1988), and <i>Remando al viento</i> (1988)
T2  - GOTHIC STUDIES

AB  - This article argues that amid the slasher carnage, three 1980s gothic films representing the literary imagination of Frankenstein attempted to proffer a vision of horror rooted in creation rather than death. In so doing they reinvigorate the radical roots of horror as a challenge to the status quo: a reconfiguration of life into forms which awaken fears as characters face precarious destinies haunted by their past. Ken Russell's Gothic (1986), Ivan Passer's Haunted Summer (1988), and Gonzalo Suarez's Remando al viento / Rowing with the Wind (1988) all depict Mary Shelley facing personal and social challenges from her (male) peers including Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Polidori. Arguably it is Mary who will in time emerge as an even more enduring literary voice, evinced by the fact of her being the protagonist of these films. During the Summer at Villa Diodati on the shores of Lake Geneva where each of these authors sought to create stories of horror, the films imagine the psychosexual power games and intellectual debates which surrounded these literary conjurations. All three films also depict an intrusion of the supernatural as Mary's monster actually manifests in the liminal space between waking and dreaming. Though wildly different in tone and affect, all three films represent a Gothicism (or an adjacent Gothic allusion) distinct from either the nostalgic or the dismissive deployment of its tropes in other genre films at the time and in so doing raise questions about 1980s cinema and culture more broadly.

AB  - Motivated by the recent trend towards low multiplicative complexity blockciphers (e.g., Zorro, CHES 2013; LowMC, EUROCRYPT 2015; HADES, EUROCRYPT 2020; MALICIOUS, CRYPTO 2020), we study their underlying structure partial SPNs, i.e., Substitution-Permutation Networks (SPNs) with parts of the substitution layer replaced by an identity mapping, and put forward the first provable security analysis for such partial SPNs built upon dedicated linear layers. For different instances of partial SPNs using MDS linear layers, we establish strong pseudorandom security as well as practical provable security against impossible differential attacks. By extending the well-established MDS code-based idea, we also propose the first principled design of linear layers that ensures optimal differential propagation. Our results formally confirm the conjecture that partial SPNs achieve the same security as normal SPNs while consuming less non-linearity, in a well-established framework.

AB  - Threshing of grain mass in the threshing and separating devices is one of the most "noisy" operations. The main noise sources of a working thresher are the processes of impact interaction of grain with the threshing device cover. Based on the simulation of dynamic and acoustic processes, a formula for calculating the noise level generated by the dynamic contact of free grain with the details of the thresher design, which allows planning of the organizational and technical measures to reduce noise at workplaces, was obtained.

AB  - Although zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) responds to nitrogen (N) application in the field, especially during the establishment phase, no guidelines are available for the preferred form of N for these species. A greenhouse experiment was performed to see how zoysiagrass responds to nitrate and urea as N sources. Z. japonica cv. El Toro (fast-growing) and cv. Meyer (slow-growing) and Z. matrella cv. Zorro (fast-growing) and cv. Diamond (slow-growing) were chosen for this study. Plants were clonally propagated as phytomers, established in 21 cm deep cone-tainers filled with a sand-based growth medium. The treatment consisted of a modified, half-strength Hoagland's solution with five different nitrate : urea ratios (100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, 0 : 100). Plant responses were assessed in terms of biomass production (leaf, culm, roots, and total plant dry weight) and rooting characteristics (length, area, diameter, volume, tips, forks, crossings, and root volume ratio) 10 weeks after the initiation of the experiment. The differing sources of N resulted in changes in plant growth and development. The cultivars had different above and below-ground biomass and root architecture traits. El Toro had the highest total biomass production (2.083 g plant(-1) DW), while Meyer and Zorro together averaged 0.734 g plant(-1) DW (65% less than El Toro). Diamond was the least productive in terms of leaf, culm, and root biomass (0.278g plant(-1) DW; 87% less than El Toro). Furthermore, above- and below-ground DW production was greatest following treatment with 25 : 75 nitrate:urea, whereas 100% nitrate produced plants with the lowest DW. Zoysiagrass rooting traits were only minimally influenced by N source; as the concentration of urea increased, slight increases in root surface area and volume were observed, accompanied by a decline in the root volume ratio.

AB  - The Triassic Agua de la Zorra Formation crops out in the Paramillos de Uspallata area (NW of Mendoza) and represents a deltaic-lacustrine system with volcanic activity as well as episodic incursions of peperitic basalts. The succession is characterized by distal lacustrine facies at base and top, with proximal shallow facies in the middle section. The paleontological record includes invertebrates (spinicaudatans, insects), vertebrates (mainly fishs), tetrapod tracks and invertebrates traces, and plant remains (mainly referred to Umkomasiales). Kerogen in the distal facies is mostly terrigenous, with scarce amorphous and palynomorphs (disacates and microalgae). It shows a variable percentage of the total organic carbon content (between 0.2 and 4.6) with hydrogen and oxygen indices indicating a type III kerogen. In the shallow facies, kerogen is practically absent and the trace fossils reflect sporadic subaerial exposure. The palynological evidence indicates an oligotrophic lake and the low productivity recorded was likely caused by dilution of the lake water by strong fluvial influence in an overfilled lake basin type. The organic geochemistry data also suggests an overfilled lake basin and the inorganic geochemistry data support the development of anoxic conditions at the bottom of the paleolake. The spinicau-data valves occur in densely packed beds that could have been driven by changes in the water physicochemical parameters as a result of volcanic activity in the area. The volcanic activity in the area is a good explanation for variability in the biota diversity. However, the continuous record of plant remains through out the section seems to indicates that the paleoenvironmental conditions in the surrounding terrestrial areas were stables.

TI  - The discovery and early history of the Mt Leyshon gold deposit, north Queensland
T2  - PACRIM 2004 CONGRESS
LA  - English
CP  - PACRIM 2004 Congress
AB  - The Mt Leyshon gold deposit produced in excess of three million ounces of gold and considerable silver over a period of approximately 130 years. Most of this production occurred between 1987 and 2001. Mining commenced in 1872, however it was highly likely that Chinese miners were not only removing alluvial gold from the area but were also mining very rich 'reef' gold. Records for early alluvial and hard rock mining do not exist, however gold production was probably considerable.
   In the early 1980s Marathon Petroleum (Australia) Ltd (MPAL) joint ventured into the Mt Leyshon area which had been held as a mining lease by Noranda Australia Ltd since 1968. Noranda at that time was concentrating its exploration effort on the Balcooma base metal prospect areas to the north of Charters Towers. In early 1982 MPALs parent company was taken over by US Steel. This led to an opportunity for MPALs Australian management to purchase all tenements and licences (except for coal, oil and gas) which were duly purchased for $US 1 million. At this time MPAL had a remarkable array of gold tenements (many of which were subsequently mined by other companies) and Mt Leyshon was considered to be the highlight. Early 'seed' capital ($A 3.1 million) was raised with backers being the Bank of America, the NSW Government Superannuation Scheme, Westpac, private individuals and a Queensland grocery chain by the name of 'Jack the Slasher'.
   The Pan Australian Mining Ltd prospectus was registered for the issue of 28 million shares of 25 cents each and a premium of 15 cents to raise $A 11.2 million in late 1984. The highlight of the prospectus was the low-grade reserve of 16.5 million tonnes @ 1.4 g/t Au at Mt Leyshon. In house it was estimated that the deposit contained in excess of six million tonnes @ 2 g/t of oxidised ore which was amenable to heap leaching. It was also known at this time that less than one quarter of the deposit had been delineated. Drilling was continuing with some exceptional intersections reported.
   In mid 1986 Pan Australian Mining Ltd purchased Nomnda Australia Ltd's 50 per cent share in Mt Leyshon for $A 5.75 million. This would later rate as one of the best buys in decades. In its first 12 months of operation the deposit produced approximately twice the amount of gold that had been produced in the previous 100 years, The mine was ultimately taken over and controlled by Normandy Poseidon in 1989.

AB  - The continental deposits of the Cuyana Basin, western Argentina, have yielded the most diverse, but so far almost unstudied, Triassic ichthyofaunas of South America. Here, we review these faunas and show that only eight of the 29 named taxa can be considered valid, including the chondrostean Neochallaia, the acrolepid Challaia, Guaymayenia, a taxon of uncertain affinities, and five species of the perleidiform family Pseudobeaconiidae. The first three taxa most probably come from Middle Triassic sediments, while the pseudobeaconiids are of Late Triassic age. Other material, although not diagnostic, probably represents other species, and thus, the diversity of actinopterygians in the Cuyana basin is certainly higher than currently recognized. For the Late Triassic fish fauna, the absence of crown-group neopterygians and a single record of a sarcopterygian is noteworthy and probably indicates some degree of endemism in this fauna, also supported by the high abundance of pseudobeaconiids, which are unknown from other areas. Furthermore, on the basis of the age indicated by the fishes and the available geological information, we discuss the age of the local fauna of the Cerro Bayo, close to the city of Mendoza, and the Agua de la Zorra Formation, Uspallata.

AB  - Mortality of PEW diapausing larvae in the soil residue was 56% due to irrigation, 22% with moldboard plough and 16% with local cultivator. Larval mortality was 54% in cotton stalks shredded with a rotary slasher and incorporated into the soil with rotavator and 23% with the disc plough. Moths emergence from the crop residue and gin waste kept as heaps, spread or incorporated into the soil was completed from March to May and remaining larvae died when temperatures were above 40 degreesC. In the left over bells of cotton stalks kept horizontally, 3.5% larvae survived in the lower part of the heap but mortality was 100% when cotton stalks were stored in small bundles vertically. There was no major alternate host and very negligible infestation was found on Althaea rosea, Hibiscus mutabilis and on ratoon cotton. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Ontario Government has recently released its latest Provincial Policy Statement (PPS), which includes a policy concerning wetland protection. This paper uses interviews with key respondents and the results of three separate case studies that examined the former PPS in order to assess the ability of the new policy to improve wetland conservation efforts in Ontario. The case studies include wetland conservation and urban stormwater management in the City of London for the periods 1978-1999 and 1978-2000, respectively. As well, agricultural drainage that occurred in the Township of Zorra for the period 1978-1997 is used to address this management dimension. While progress is evident, the current policy will be difficult to implement effectively because it inadequately deals with the fundamental aspects of management: fragmented jurisdiction, interagency communication, financial arrangements, enforcement, and promoting informed decision making.

AB  - Two different shapes of knives (Land Y-shaped) for the rotary slasher with 30 degrees knife cutting angle at three cutting speeds (1830, 2066 and 2044 rpm) were used to indicate their effects on the power consumption for pulverizing sweet potato vine which passed through the sieve (< 28 mm(2)). The results indicated that all the treatments were significant at p < 0.01 significance level for the power consumption on sweet potato vine pulverizing. The best result was recorded from L-shaped knife with a power consumption of 52.12 Watts for sweet potato vine pulverization. Meanwhile, the best result was for the mower speed at 1830 rpm with the lowest power consumption of 61.23 Watts. The best performance for interaction between knife shapes and the cutting speeds was achieved by the L-shaped knife at 1830 rpm with lowest power consumption of 50.23 Watts at p < 0.01.

AB  - Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a globally important leguminous food crop. Yields can be reduced by high incidence of soilborne oomycetes that cause seedling disease. Breeders have attempted to develop Pythium root rot-resistant bean varieties; however, relationships between dry bean and most soilborne oomycete species remain uncharacterized. Oomycete species (n = 28), including Pythium spp. and Phytopythium spp., were tested in a growth chamber seedling assay at 20 degrees C and an in vitro seed assay at 20 degrees C and 26 degrees C to evaluate their pathogenicity and virulence on 'Red Hawk' dark red kidney bean and 'Zorro' black bean. Root size or disease severity was significantly impacted by 14 oomycete species, though results varied by bean variety, temperature, and assay. Of these 14 pathogenic oomycete species, 11 species exhibited significant differences in DSI due to temperature on at least one bean variety. Pythium aphanidermatum, P. myriotylum, P. ultimum, P. ultimum var. sporangiiferium, and P. ultimum var. ultimum were the most virulent species in both assays, causing seed rot and pre-emergence damping-off of dry bean. Oomycete species were clustered into three groups based on symptom development: seed rot pathogens, root rot pathogens, or nonpathogens. Intraspecific variability in virulence was observed for eight of the 14 pathogenic oomycete species. Improved understanding of Pythium and Phytopythium interactions with dry bean may enable breeders and pathologists to more effectively evaluate strategies for oomycete seedling disease management.

AB  - As part of a survey of the metazoan parasites of elasmobranchs of the Gulf of California, Mexico, the spiral intestines of 10 pelagic thresher sharks Alopias pelagicus and one bigeye thresher shark A. superciliosus were examined for tapeworms. Eight of the A. pelagicus specimens examined were found to host Litobothrium amplifica and L. daileyi. Both tapeworm species are redescribed based on examination of this new material with light and scanning electron microscopy, and the ranges of most of the measurements for these species are expanded; scanning electron micrographs and detailed illustrations and measurements of their segment anatomy are presented for the first time. An argument is made that the identification of the original host specimens of these species was in error and that A. pelagicus is likely to be the correct original host. In addition, L. nickoli n. sp., a third species in the genus hosted by A. pelagicus, was found in three of the 10 individual hosts examined. This species differs from all six known Litobothrium species in the form of the pseudosegments of the scolex, the anterior two being essentially non-cruciform, while the latter three are distinctly cruciform. All other species possess either no non-cruciform or at most one non-cruciform segment anteriorly. The single specimen of A. superciliosus examined was found to host the new species, L. janovyi. This species differs from L. coniformis, L. gracile and L. amsichensis in its possession of four rather than three, three and five cruciform pseudosegments, respectively. It lacks the modificiations of the fourth pseudosegment seen in L. amplifica and lacks the anterior non-cruciform fifth pseudosegment found in L. daileyi. It most closely resembles L. alopias but differs among other features in its greater total length, greater number of segments and longer mature segments. SEM of the four species collected from the Gulf of California as well as material of L. amsichensis from the goblin shark Mitsukurina owstoni that hosted the type-specimens of this species show that all surfaces of the body of all five species bear a dense covering of long filiform microtriches. L. amplifica bears a single row of large spine-like structures throughout most of the posterior margins of the first and second cruciform pseudosegment only. L. daileyi possesses one to two rows of overlapping spine-like structures on the posterior margins of the first four pseudosegments with the exception of the medial projections. The fifth pseudosegment lacks these structures. L. janovyi n. sp. bears spine-like structures on the lateral margins of only the third and fourth pseudosegments. L. nickoli n. sp. bears spine-like structures throughout the posterior margins of the first and second pseudosegments, and throughout the posterior margins of the third and fourth pseudosegments with the exception of the medial projections; the fifth pseudosegment lacks these structures. L. amsichensis bears no structures that could be considered to be spine-like on any of its pseuosegments, but possesses a border of densely arranged larger microtriches on the posterior margin of all five pseudosegments. A key to the species is included.

AB  - Thresher sharks (family Alopiidae) are highly migratory pelagic predators whose populations have drastically declined due to extensive fishing for their fins. There are only three species of thresher sharks worldwide. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed pelagic (A. pelagicus) thresher sharks as endangered while bigeye (Alopias superciliosus) and common (A. vulpinus) thresher sharks as vulnerable to extinction. There is limited scientific information about thresher shark fisheries in the Philipines. In this study we described a thresher shark fishery in Tawi-Tawi, Southern Philippines which has been existing for more than 20 years now. The fishery is generally small-scale, using simple hook and line and 13-hp inboard motorized boats with a capacity of one to two fishers per boat. Fishing is year-round with peak season occurring from March to May. Fishers spend about 10 days per month fishing during neap tide when the currents are weak. All three species of thresher sharks are caught in Tawi-Tawi. They are generally hunted for their fins and meat which are sold to local buyers. About 50 boats fish per day with about half of them catching one to two sharks. Our study suggests that monthly production of thresher sharks during the peak season in 2018 was about 15.3 mt or valued at about US$19,886.39. Our study is the first to report that the Sibutu Passage is an important fishing grounds for thresher sharks which must be put under immediate protection for effective conservation of these valuable species.

AB  - Combine harvesters are important in that grain and legumes directly affect the production economy. On the other hand, it forms an important branch of the agricultural machinery sector. There are many unknown constraints on machines when harvesting with a combine harvester, including the noise and vibration that occur in the combine harvester thresher. This study aims to analyze noise and vibration in conventional combine harvesters using sensors. Two accelerometers were installed on each side of the concave and two microphones were used to register the noise of the threshing process. The result showed that effects of machine speeds (3.5 km/h, 4.5 km/h and 5.5 km/h) and rotor speeds (950 r/min, 850 r/min and 950 r/min) were significantly important for the mean range values of the left and right accelerometer in the X, Y and Z direction. The machine's speed and rotor speed were not significantly important for the mean range values of the left and right microphones.

AB  - Pink mealybug Dysmicoccus brevipes (Cockerell) causes the pineapple wilt disease. The ant Technomyrmex albipes plays a major role in spreading the disease. The impact of three common weed management practices, as follows, on the density of ants and the fruit yield was studied: 1/ clean weeding manually, 2/ slashing with a grass slasher and 3/ either mulching with coir dust or no weeding. Clean weeded plots had the lowest ant density (2-8 per trap) and highest fruit yield (12,572 kg.ha(-1)). In the slash weeded and unweeded plots ant density was high (8-25 per trap, 20-100 per trap) and fruit yield was low (3,740 kg.ha(-1) .- 2,230 kg.ha(-1)). Insecticidal sprays gave momentary ant control but they appeared within three weeks. Hydramethylnon ("Amdro") eliminated ants within two weeks and ants did not re-establish that soon.

AB  - In this study information on the development of combined sweet potato harvester is presented. The study focuses on the design, manufacture and choice of the best slasher for cutting and fragmentation of stems and leaves (vegetative portion) for the crop to facilitate the process of harvesting and extraction of tubers. A survey on various types and forms of cutters (mowers) and knives normally used for cutting vines and leaves was conducted and concluded that the vertical type and flail type mowers are the most effective in removing of the vegetative growth. In addition there is a need to design an integrated harvester, which combines both the cutting and digging in a single pass in order to reduce the time taken for harvesting, the fuel consumption and the number of machines used since this will give some economical advantages. In addition to the design requirements, it is recommended that number of tests should be conducted to select the suitable speed for the tractor, the velocity for cutters and the length of knives for both sides of the ridges to avoid damage to the tubers.

AB  - Metabolic enzyme activities in red (RM) and white (WM) myotomal muscle and in the heart ventricle (HV) were compared in two lamnid sharks (shortfin mako and salmon shark), the common thresher shark and several other actively swimming shark species. The metabolic enzymes measured were citrate synthase (CS), an index of aerobic capacity, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an index of anaerobic capacity. WM creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity, an index of rapid ATP production during burst swimming, was also quantified. Enzyme activities in RM, WM and HV were similar in the two lamnid species. Interspecific comparisons of enzyme activities at a common reference temperature (20degreesC) show no significant differences in RM CS activity but higher CS activity in the WM and HV of the lamnid sharks compared with the other species. For the other enzymes, activities in lamnids overlapped with those of other shark species. Comparison of the HV spongy and compact myocardial layers in mako, salmon and thresher sharks reveals a significantly greater spongy CS activity in all three species but no differences in LDH activity. Adjustment of enzyme activities to in vivo RM and WM temperatures in the endothermic lamnids elevates CS and LDH in both tissues relative to the ectothermic sharks. Thus, through its enhancement of both RM and WM enzyme activity, endothermy may be an important determinant of energy supply for sustained and burst swimming in the lamnids. Although lamnid WM is differentially warmed as a result of RM endothermy, regional differences in WM CS and LDH activities and thermal sensitivities (Q(10) values) were not found. The general pattern of the endothermic myotomal and ectothermic HV muscle metabolic enzyme activities in the endothermic lamnids relative to other active, ectothermic sharks parallels the general pattern demonstrated for the endothermic tunas relative to their ectothermic sister species. However, the activities of all enzymes measured are lower in lamnids than in tunas. Relative to lamnids, the presence of lower WM enzyme activities in the thresher shark (which is in the same order as the lamnids, has an RM morphology similar to that of the mako and salmon sharks and may be endothermic) suggests that other factors, such as behavior and swimming pattern, also affect shark myotomal organization and metabolic function.

AB  - Since 1950, the year of Grzybowski's syndrome description by Marian Grzybowski in Warsaw, 30 cases have been described in the literature. This syndrome belongs to the family of multiple generalized keratoacanthomas (KA). It occurs in adults between 50 and 70 years. Clinically, it presents as a rash of hundreds or thousands of small papules 1 to 2 mm with welldefined, sometimes keratotic center. The onset is sudden, the evolution is progressive and chronic. It is accompanied by severe and persistent pruritus. There is no family history of KA and histology is compatible with that of KA. Other criteria may be present to varying degrees: the type of facial rash Mask of Zorro, mucosal rash, ectropion, the presence of crater- like lesions. We studied the case of a 58-year-old patient followed in the plastic surgery department of Nemes'hospital for excision of several skin tumors as part of a Grzybowski's syndrome evolving since 2005. Its handling global and multidisciplinary treatments combining early surgical and complex medical treatments represents a therapeutic challenge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) is a resilient pelagic species that could provide long-term highly productive fisheries. Using FAO data we document enormous increases (746%) in reported global mahi-mahi landings since 1950. Detailed mahi-mahi fisheries records are limited, but an observer program monitoring Costa Rica's Pacific mahi-mahi pelagic longline fleet between 1999 and 2008 (n = 217 sets) provided a rare opportunity to quantify bycatch in these fisheries. Several sea turtles and sharks of global conservation concern were caught incidentally: olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea; n = 1348, mean = 9.05 per 1000 hooks), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis; n = 402, mean = 2.96 per 1000 hooks), thresher sharks (Alopias sp.; n = 158, mean = 1.12 per 1000 hooks), green turtle (Chelonia mydas; n = 49, mean = 0.35 per 1000 hooks), and three other threatened sharks in small numbers. Pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea; a ray of low conservation concern) was also a common bycatch (n = 625, mean = 4.77 per 1000 hooks). Generalized linear models (GLMs) of catch rates showed increases in olive ridley turtles and decreases in mahi-mahi and silky sharks over the decade examined. The high hooking survival rates of olive ridley and green turtles in observed sets (95% and 96% respectively) suggest that widespread training of the fleet in careful gear removal and turtle release methods could be one effective bycatch mitigation strategy for these species. GLMs also provide evidence that closing the fishery during peak olive ridley nesting times (at least near nesting beaches), in combination with reduced gear soak times, could help minimize the fishery's impacts on threatened bycatch species while still maintaining a productive fishery.

AB  - The continental sedimentary rocks that constitute the Palo Pintado Formation of the late Miocene from Salta province, presents a great paleoclimatic interest due to the environmental conditions prevailing during this geochronologic interval. The geological and paleobotanical data suggest that during the sedimentary rocks accumulation of the Palo Pintado Formation (Angastaco Basin), wetter conditions would have existed comparing with other nearby and contemporary Formations, for example the Playa del Zorro Aloformation (late Miocene of Catamarca) and the Chiquimil (late Miocene of Tucuman), Salicas and the Toro Negro Formations (both from the late Miocene of La Rioja). In this study, the margin and the foliar area of the leaves contained on rocks from the Palo Pintado Formation are analyzed, in order to obtain the mean annual temperature (MAT) and the mean annual precipitation (MAP). The resulting values were: 23.98 degrees C and 330.8 mm. These results are coincident by the interpretation of different authors, who consider that the Palo Pintado Fonnation would have been deposited under a relatively humid environment, possibly as a consequence of the rains that affected locally the Angastaco basin region

TI  - A new black bean with resistance to bean rust: Registration of 'ND Twilight'
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS

KW  - PULSES
AB  - 'ND Twilight' (Reg. no. CV-332, PI 693268; PVP-202000258) is a new black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivar developed by the Dry Edible Bean Breeding Program at North Dakota State University and released by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. ND Twilight was developed using a modified pedigree method (F-1-F-5), followed by pure line selection based on agronomic, disease, and quality traits, along with specific DNA markers. With similar to 24% of the total dry bean production in the United States, black bean is the second most important market class after pinto. Accounting for similar to 35% of the total production, North Dakota is the largest producer of dry bean in the United States. However, both biotic and abiotic stresses are the main factors responsible for seed yield reductions. Between 2014 and 2019, ND Twilight was tested across more than 21 environments in North Dakota, where seed yield was significantly different from 'Zorro' and similar to 'Eclipse' and 'Loreto'. ND Twilight is resistant to the most common race (20-3) of the bean rust pathogen and Bean common mosaic virus. It also has intermediate resistance to common bacterial blight and to soybean cyst nematode (HG Type 0). ND Twilight has desirable upright architecture (Type IIa). Under North Dakota conditions, ND Twilight shows an average plant height of 49 cm, has a 100-seed weight of 19.7 g, and matures in similar to 99 d. Canning quality was rated as acceptable. Other traits of agronomic and economic importance are within acceptable commercial ranges.

AB  - Triticale is a cereal of high economic importance; however, along with the increase in the area of this cereal, it is more often infected by the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis, which causes powdery mildew. The rapid development of molecular biology techniques, in particular methods based on molecular markers may be an important tool used in modern plant breeding. Development of genetic maps, location of the QTLs defining the region of the genome associated with resistance and selection of markers linked to particular trait can be used to select resistant genotypes as well as to pyramidize several resistance genes in one variety. In this paper, we present a new, high-density genetic map of triticale doubled haploids (DH) population "Grenado" x "Zorro" composed of DArT, silicoDArT, and SNP markers. Composite interval mapping method was used to detect eight QTL regions associated with the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and 15 regions with the average value of powdery mildew infection (avPM) based on observation conducted in 3-year period in three different locations across the Poland. Two regions on rye chromosome 4R, and single loci on 5R and 6R were reported for the first time as regions associated with powdery mildew resistance. Among all QTLs, 14 candidate genes were identified coded cyclin-dependent kinase, serine/threonine-protein kinase-like protein as well as AMEIOTIC 1 homolog DYAD-like protein, DETOXIFICATION 16-like protein, and putative disease resistance protein RGA3. Three of identified candidate genes were found among newly described QTL regions associated with powdery mildew resistance in triticale.

AB  - Pineapple is traditionally cultivated in peat soil in Malaysia but increasingly is also being cultivated in mineral soil. MARDI has been working hard to improve traditional agriculture practices by developing practices that are adaptable to the local industry but that also increase the income of local farmers. For pineapple production especially on mineral soil, MARDI has tested and evaluated a mechanization package that may help increase pineapple production. The machinery package includes a pineapple transplanter, an inter-row cultivator cum fertilizer applicator, a boom sprayer, a boom conveyor fruit harvester, pineapple leaf slasher and plant mulcher cum shredder. This study was conducted to evaluate the cost of the operation and also the potential productivity of the mechanized system. A study on the FIMA farm in 2008 to 2009 showed that the mechanized system in mineral soil achieved an average yield of about 44.7 t/ha/h, with about 18.9% loss due to product rejection. An economic forecast has been projected based on this result with some relevant assumptions, the viable acreage for the implementation of this mechanization a minimum of 40 ha with a payback period of 3.5 years, an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 36.7% and a Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of 1.05. The Nett Present Value (NPV) for the mechanization system on this particular acreage will be around RM 476,732.45.

AB  - Due to the ever-growing demand for bast fibres for technical and garment textiles, complementary sources to textile flax, whose cultivation in western Europe cannot really be extended, need to be proposed. In this study, the interest in harvesting and processing linseed flax straw is studied for geotextile applications. The main critical stages of fibre-to-yarn production for geotextiles were investigated. Different dew retting levels as well as different all-fibre extraction processes were investigated to achieve this objective. It was demonstrated that the fibres extracted from linseed flax stems subjected to 12 weeks of dew retting using breaking rollers, thresher and a breaking card exhibited the most suitable morphological and mechanical properties. The optimal fibres were converted into 100% linseed flax yarns using a flyer spinning machine, and the mechanical properties as well as the biodegradability of the linseed yarns were evaluated to understand their potential as geotextiles. These linseed flax yarns were further coated with linseed oil or chitosan to enhance their durability. It was observed that the linseed oil coating better preserved the yarn's integrity and mechanical properties over time, and it permitted doubling their service life potential.

AB  - Keyed and unkeyed cryptographic permutations often iterate simple round functions. Substitution-permutation networks (SPNs) are an approach that is popular since the mid 1990s. One of the new directions in the design of these round functions is to reduce the substitution (S-Box) layer from a full one to a partial one, uniformly distributed over all the rounds. LowMC and Zorro are examples of this approach.
   A relevant freedom in the design space is to allow for a highly non-uniform distribution of S-Boxes. However, choosing rounds that are so different from each other is very rarely done, as it makes security analysis and implementation much harder.
   We develop the design strategy HADES and an analysis framework for it, which despite this increased complexity allows for security arguments against many classes of attacks, similar to earlier simpler SPNs. The framework builds upon the wide trail design strategy, and it additionally allows for security arguments against algebraic attacks, which are much more of a concern when algebraically simple S-Boxes are used.
   Subsequently, this is put into practice by concrete instances and benchmarks for a use case that generally benefits from a smaller number of S-Boxes and showcases the diversity of design options we support: A candidate cipher natively working with objects in GF(p), for securing data transfers with distributed databases using secure multiparty computation (MPC). Compared to the currently fastest design MiMC, we observe significant improvements in online bandwidth requirements and throughput with a simultaneous reduction of preprocessing effort, while having a comparable online latency.

AB  - Phytocystatins (PCs) are protein inhibitors of endogenous plant endopeptidases and exogenous pathogen proteinases. We have previously described the protein inhibitor TrcC-4, which is probably involved in the control of protein degradation during triticale seeds germination. The occurrence of the LARFAVXEHN motif supports the TrcC-4 designation as a PC. In this paper TrcC-4 was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET28 expression vector. TrcC-4(6xHis) was purified by affinity chromatography with a single step of purification. Western blot analysis showed the presence of TrcC-4 in both developing and germinating triticale seeds. TrcC-4 protein level was higher both in scutellum of germinating seeds and in developing grains of the triticale cultivar more resistant to pre-harvest sprouting (Zorro) than in a less resistant one (Disco). Furthermore it was demonstrated that the activity of EP8, cysteine endopeptidase responsible for the mass hydrolysis of prolamin during germination, is inhibited by TrcC-4(6xHis), as confirmed by native PAGE with gliadin as a substrate. These results suggest that phytocystatin TrcC-4 controls the activity of cysteine endopeptidases involved in germination and, thus, is potentially involved in pre-harvest sprouting.

AB  - In this study, we seek to understand the feasibility of energy harvesting from the tail beating motion of a fish through active compliant materials. Specifically, we analyze energy harvesting from the undulations of a biomimetic fish tail hosting ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs). The design of the biomimetic tail is specifically inspired by the morphology of the heterocercal tail of thresher sharks. We propose a modeling framework for the underwater vibration of the biomimetic tail, wherein the tail is assimilated to a cantilever beam with rectangular cross section. We focus on base excitation in the form of a superimposed rotation about a fixed axis and we consider the regime of moderately large-amplitude vibrations. In this context, the effect of the encompassing fluid is described through a nonlinear hydrodynamic function. The feasibility of harvesting energy from an IPMC attached to the vibrating structure is assessed and modeled via an electromechanical framework. Experiments are performed to validate the theoretical expectations on energy harvesting from the biomimetic tail.

AB  - Chickpea seed yield is highly variable as a result of biotic, mostly fungal, and abiotic stresses including extreme temperatures and water stress. The effect of stress on yield depends on its intensity, timing and duration, hence the importance of knowing the critical window of yield formation and stress vulnerability. This window has not been determined in chickpea. To fill this gap, we compared the effect of sequential 14-d shading periods on the yield and yield components of two chickpea varieties, PBA Boundary and PBA Slasher, in three environments where unshaded controls yielded between, 2880 and 3130 kg ha(-1). Unlike other species which do not respond to stress early in the season, shading reduced yield from emergence until the beginning of the critical period, 300 degrees Cd before flowering (base temperature = 0 degrees C). The critical period was found to be at least 800 degrees Cd long centred 100 degrees Cd after flowering. Seed number accounted for most of the variation in yield, which was unrelated to seed size. Pod number accounted for most of the variation in seed number prior to the critical period, while pod number and seeds per pod contributed to seed number within the critical period. After 400 degrees Cd post flowering, seeds per pod was the main variable affecting seed number. This information can be used in breeding and agronomy to improve stress adaptation.

TI  - The Searching Camera: First-Person Shooters, Found-Footage Horror Films, and the Documentary Tradition
T2  - JCMS-JOURNAL OF CINEMA AND MEDIA STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Alexander Galloway has argued that the subjective camera of first-person shooter (FPS) games marks a distinct break from cinematic traditions. In this article, I suggest that the FPS camera might belong to a longer history of "searching" cameras that begins with another kind of first-person camerawork: handheld cinematography. To understand the meanings of the handheld camera, this article looks to the documentary tradition. The horror genre provides two notable analogues for the FPS camera: the "killer POV" sequences that were an emblem of the slasher era and the faux-documentary handheld cameras of the "found footage" cycle that came to prominence in cinema alongside the rise of the FPS in gaming. Found footage, unlike FPS, is predicated on looking within the film being a fundamentally vulnerable act and on the helplessness of the viewer to intervene in the action on-screen. While the "shooter" in "first-person shooter" indicates a marriage of action and looking, games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent (Frictional Games, 2010) and Layers of Fear (Bloober Team, 2016) have, like found footage films, equated "horror" with a sense of helplessness and vulnerability by removing combat as an option and by minimizing the player's capacity for control. Thus, the contemporary horror genre is being defined across media through an emphasis on the vulnerability and impotence of the searching camera.

AB  - Tracking bits through block ciphers and optimizing attacks at hand is one of the tedious task symmetric cryptanalysts have to deal with. It would be nice if a program will automatically handle them at least for well-known attack techniques, so that cryptanalysts will only focus on finding new attacks. However, current automatic tools cannot be used as is, either because they are tailored for specific ciphers or because they only recover a specific part of the attacks and cryptographers are still needed to finalize the analysis.
   In this paper we describe a generic algorithm exhausting the best meet-in-the-middle and impossible differential attacks on a very large class of block ciphers from byte to bit-oriented, SPN, Feistel and LaiMassey block ciphers. Contrary to previous tools that target to find the best differential / linear paths in the cipher and leave the cryptanalysts to find the attack using these paths, we automatically find the best attacks by considering the cipher and the key schedule algorithms. The building blocks of our algorithm led to two algorithms designed to find the best simple meet-in-the-middle attacks and the best impossible truncated differential attacks respectively. We recover and improve many attacks on AES, mCRYPTON, SIMON, IDEA, KTANTAN, PRINCE and ZORRO. We show that this tool can be used by designers to improve their analysis.

AB  - Native perennial grasses were once common in California prairies that are now dominated by annual grasses introduced from Europe. Competition from exotics may be a principal impediment to reestablishment of native perennial grasses. Introduced annual grasses, such as Vulpia myuros (zorro fescue), are often included with native perennial species in revegetation seed mixtures used in California. To examine the potential suppressive effect of this graminoid, we evaluated the growth and performance of a mixture of California native perennial grasses and resident weeds when grown with varying densities of V. myuros. The annual fescue exhibited a strongly plastic growth response to plant density, producing similar amounts of above-ground biomass at all seeding densities. Perennial grass seedling survival and above- ground biomass decreased and individuals became thinner (i.e., reduced weight-to-height ratio) with increasing V. myuros seeding density. V. myuros also significantly suppressed above-ground biomass and densities of weeds and had a more negative effect on weed densities than on native perennial grass densities. Biomass of native grasses and weeds was not differentially affected by increasing densities of V. myuros. Overall, because V. myuros significantly reduced the survival and performance of the mixture of native perennial grasses and this effect increased with increasing V. myuros density, we conclude that including this exotic annual in native seed mixtures is counterproductive to restoration efforts.

AB  - Streamside vegetated buffer strips (riparian zones) are often assumed to be zones of ground water nitrate (NO3-) attenuation. At a site in southwestern Ontario (Zorra site), detailed monitoring revealed that elevated NO3--N (4-93 mg L-1) persisted throughout a 100-m-wide riparian floodplain. Typical of riparian zones, the site has a soil zone of recent river alluvium that, is organic carbon (OC) rich (36 +/- 16 g kg(-1)). This material is underlain by an older glacial outwash aquifer with a much lower OC content (2.3 +/- 2.5 g kg(-1)). Examination of NO3-, Cl-, SO42-, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations; N/Cl ratios; and NO3- isotopic composition (delta N-15 and delta O-18) provides evidence of four, distinct NO3- source zones within the riparian environment. Denitrification occurs but is incomplete and is restricted to a narrow interval located within similar to 0.5 m of the alluvium- aquifer contact and to one zone (poultry manure compost zone) where elevated DOC persists from the source. In older ground water close to the, river discharge point, denitrification, remains insufficient to substantially deplete NO3-. Overall, denitrification related specifically to the riparian environment is limited at this site. The persistence of NO3- in the aquifer at this site is a consequence of its Pleistocene age and resulting low OC content, in contrast to recent fluvial sediments in modern agricultural terrain, which, even if permeable, usually have zones enriched in labile OC. Thus, sediment age and origin are additional factors that should be considered when assessing the potential for riparian zone denitrification.

AB  - Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with physiological resistance to Fusarium Root Rot (FRR) and root architecture traits were mapped in a black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. The parents of this population were the landrace Puebla 152 and the cultivar Zorro that differed in root architecture traits. The population was screened against FRR strain FSP-3 in the greenhouse in Uganda and for root architecture traits measured under disease free conditions in the greenhouse in California. The population was also genotyped with 5398 SNP markers using the BARCBean_3_6K Beadchip. Four QTL associated with root architecture traits and one QTL associated with FRR resistance were detected. Total root weight and shallow root weight were associated with the same QTL on chromosome Pv09 at 0.29 Mb. A QTL associated with root length was detected on Pv01 that was independent of the fin gene which controls shoot determinacy. Deep root weight and total plant biomass were associated with the same QTL on Pv05 at 39.20 Mb and mapped 260 kb from the QTL associated with FRR resistance, suggestive of a possible association. None of the QTL accounted for more than 13 % of phenotypic variation, indicative of the fact that several genes of minor influence govern FRR resistance and root traits. Puebla 152 was the source of the beneficial alleles in each QTL detected in this study and is a useful genetic source of root architecture traits that may be valuable in breeding for root rot avoidance in common bean.

AB  - The fishing industry has been facing problems related to catch yields, predatory competition and economic collapse. Management should be based on substantial scientific studies and the state's ability to implement these. In Brazil, the surface longline fishery has been in existence since the 1950s, and remains of great economic importance. This study analyzes 179 legal instruments (1934-2014), divided into restrictive, administrative and promotional, comparing with catches landed (1996-2011). The results show that there was a complete disrespect for the regulations, wherein fleets continued landing prohibited or size limited species, such as Kajikia albida, Makaira nigricans, Alopias superciliosus, A. vulpinus, Carcharhinus longimanus, Galeorhinus galeus and Xiphias gladius. Furthermore, divergent regulatory provisions have hindered understanding/implementation of regulations by all those involved. Being a country of continental proportions and with different longline fisheries along the coast, conducting scientific studies and the development of normative approaches becomes a huge challenge. In a dynamic activity such as fishing, the constant review of these regulations will allow fisheries management to become more accurate and in accordance with the aspirations of the different interests involved. Despite the surface longline fishery having operated for 60 years in Brazil, the existence of incongruous laws makes the management and control of this activity incompatible with the conservation of species. The lack of regulations governing this fishery creates a "gap", increasing the risk of extinction of species (target and bycatch) and the future collapse of this activity.

AB  - Application of synthetic herbicides is currently the most widely used and cost-effective methods to assist with revegetation programs. However, the effects of short-term application of herbicides such as Roundup, acetic acid, BioWeed (TM) and Slasher (R) as compared with mulch, on soil microbial biomass and microbial diversity remain unknown. This study examined the effects of short-term herbicide application on soil microbial biomass, C:N ratio, and fungal and bacterial communities at months 2 and 8 following initiation of treatment application. No effects of treatments on soil pH, C:N and microbial biomass were found. No segregation among treatments in the community structure of bacteria and fungi was observed. However, the fungal phylum Basiodiomycota had one unidentified class, which was only found in the mulch treatment, suggesting the C quality in the mulch treatment may differ compared with the other treatments. The dry and hot conditions experienced throughout the study period may have resulted in fast degradation of the herbicides and may have minimised the impacts of the herbicides on microbial diversity and community structure. Given that the research was undertaken at a single site and over only a short time frame, the results should be extrapolated with caution. Herbicides may have greater impact with long-term use. Future research will need to assess the revegetation success of each treatment and determine if the observed change in Basidiomycota profile and C quality identified in this study becomes significant over the long-term. We hypothesise that mulching may be a preferred treatment to facilitate weed control in riparian zone revegetation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report the discovery of two TESS sub-Neptunes orbiting the early M dwarf TOI-904 (TIC 261257684). Bothexoplanets, 2.426(-0.157)(+0.163) and 2.167(-0.118)(+0.130), were initially observed in TESS Sector 12 with twin sizes of 2.49 and 2.31 R-circle plus, respectively. Through observations in five additional sectors in the TESS primary mission and the first and second extended missions, the orbital periods of the planets were measured to be 10.887 +/- 0.001 and 83.999 +/- 0.001 days, respectively. Reconnaissance radial velocity measurements (taken with EULER/CORALIE and SMARTS/CHIRON) and high-resolution speckle imaging with adaptive optics (obtained from SOAR/HRCAM and Gemini South/ZORRO) show no evidence of an eclipsing binary or a nearby companion, which, together with the low false-positive probabilities calculated with the statistical validation software TRICERATOPS, establishes the planetary nature of these candidates. The outer planet, TOI-904 c, is the longest-period M dwarf exoplanet found by TESS, with an estimated equilibrium temperature of 217 K. As the three other validated planets with comparable host stars and orbital periods were observed by Kepler around much dimmer stars (J(mag) > 12), TOI-904 c, orbiting a brighter star (J(mag) = 9.6), is the coldest M dwarf planet easily accessible for atmospheric follow-up. Future mass measurements and transmission spectroscopy of the similar-sized planets in this system could determine whether they are also similar in density and composition, suggesting a common formation pathway, or whether they have distinct origins.

AB  - Nonglacial deposits of Middle Wisconsin age are being discovered with increased frequency across a broad region of southern Ontario, Canada, and provide strong evidence for a time of significant ice withdrawal from the lower Great Lakes region. With each new discovery, a refined understanding of regional climatic and paleoecological environments is emerging. In this paper, we present the results of a sedimentological and paleoecological study of a subtill organic deposit in Zorra Township, southwestern Ontario. The organic deposit, which lies beneath Nissouri Phase Catfish Creek Till (Late Wisconsin), has been dated by accelerator mass spectrometry at between 50.5 and 42.9 C-14 ka BP. The organic remains are contained within slack water pond deposits infilling a channel incised into till either of Early Wisconsin or Illinoian age. The fossil assemblage appears to be strongly influenced by taphonomic processes, including degradation due to oxidation, bacterial and fungal decay, and glacial overriding. Reworking and (or) recycling and selective sorting as well as long-distance transport has also influenced the composition of the fossil assemblage preserved. Nonetheless, meaningful paleoecological information is still obtained from this record. Collectively, the pollen and plant macrofossils indicate a boreal-type pine-spruce forest with temperatures cooler than present. The absence of arctic tundra plants, as are found in many other deposits of similar age in the lower Great Lakes basin, is notable. A pond or wetland inhabited by shoreline herbs, shrubs, and trees was present at or proximal to the site. The freshwater mollusc and ostracode assemblages are consistent with a shallow water habitat with dense submerged vegetation. The terrestrial mollusc assemblage suggests a taiga or transitional taiga-tundra fauna. Together, these fossil groups provide one of the most comprehensive environmental reconstructions of Middle Wisconsin time (oxygen isotope stage 3 or OIS3) in southern Ontario and serve to build on the ever-increasing database of paleoecological information accumulating for this episode of the late Quaternary.

AB  - In this paper, we study energy harvesting from the beating of a biomimetic fish tail using ionic polymer-metal composites. The design of the biomimetic tail is based on carangiform swimmers and is specifically inspired by the morphology of the heterocercal tail of thresher sharks. The tail is constituted of a soft silicone matrix molded in the form of the heterocercal tail and reinforced by a steel beam of rectangular cross section. We propose a modeling framework for the underwater vibration of the biomimetic tail, wherein the tail is assimilated to a cantilever beam with rectangular cross section and heterogeneous physical properties. We focus on base excitation in the form of a superimposed rotation about a fixed axis and we consider the regime of moderately large-amplitude vibrations. In this context, the effect of the encompassing fluid is described through a hydrodynamic function, which accounts for inertial, viscous and convective phenomena. The model is validated through experiments in which the base excitation is systematically varied and the motion of selected points on the biomimetic tail tracked in time. The feasibility of harvesting energy from an ionic polymer-metal composite attached to the vibrating structure is experimentally and theoretically assessed. The response of the transducer is described using a black-box model, where the voltage output is controlled by the rate of change of the mean curvature. Experiments are performed to elucidate the impact of the shunting resistance, the frequency of the base excitation and the placement of the ionic polymer-metal composite on energy harvesting from the considered biomimetic tail.

AB  - We present the discovery and validation of two TESS exoplanets orbiting nearby M dwarfs: TOI-2084 b, and TOI-4184 b. We characterized the host stars by combining spectra from Shane/Kast and Magellan/FIRE, spectral energy distribution analysis, and stellar evolutionary models. In addition, we used Gemini-South/Zorro & -North/Alopeke high-resolution imaging, archival science images, and statistical validation packages to support the planetary interpretation. We performed a global analysis of multi-colour photometric data from TESS and ground-based facilities in order to derive the stellar and planetary physical parameters for each system. We find that TOI-2084 b and TOI-4184 b are sub-Neptune-sized planets with radii of R-p = 2.47 +/- 0.13R(circle plus) and R-p = 2.43 +/- 0.21 R-circle plus, respectively. TOI-2084 b completes an orbit around its host star every 6.08 days, has an equilibrium temperature of T-eq = 527 +/- 8 K and an irradiation of S-p = 12.8 +/- 0.8 S-circle plus. Its host star is a dwarf of spectral M2.0 +/- 0.5 at a distance of 114 pc with an effective temperature of T-eff = 3550 +/- 50 K, and has a wide, co-moving M8 companion at a projected separation of 1400 au. TOI-4184 b orbits around an M5.0 +/- 0.5 type dwarf star (K-mag = 11.87) each 4.9 days, and has an equilibrium temperature of T-eq = 412 +/- 8 K and an irradiation of S-p = 4.8 +/- 0.4 S-circle plus. TOI-4184 is a metal poor star ([Fe/H] = -0.27 +/- 0.09 dex) at a distance of 69 pc with an effective temperature of T-eff = 3225 +/- 75 K. Both planets are located at the edge of the sub-Jovian desert in the radius-period plane. The combination of the small size and the large infrared brightness of their host stars make these new planets promising targets for future atmospheric exploration with JWST.

AB  - The effects of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on storage and postharvest quality of F-1 hybrid tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 'Zorro') were investigated. Tomatoes were harvested at mature green and pink stages and packed with Xtend (R) bags. Air stored fruits were considered as control. All samples were stored at 12 degrees C with 90% RH for 35 days. Weight loss, elasticity, skin color, ethylene production, lycopene, polygalactronase (PG) activity and decay parameters were investigated with intervals of 7 days. At the end of the storage, MAP of either mature green or pink fruits reduced the weight loss and decay. Among mature green tomatoes stored in MAP, the amount of decayed fruit was 5.88%, while this level for control fruits was 19.61%. MAP also delayed the increase of ethylene emission rate (detected by GC) and polygalactronase activity and the higher elasticity obtained from MAP compared to control. At the end of the storage, elasticity values were significantly higher in fruits of both maturity stages stored in MAPs (69.50 and 56.13 shore for mature green and pink fruits, respectively) than those of the control groups (55.73 and 46.53 shore for mature green and pink stages, respectively). Furthermore MAP alleviated the increment of PG activities in fruits of both stages. Mature green fruit had lower weight loss, decay, lycopene accumulation, ethylene production values, whereas they had higher hue angle and elasticity values than pink fruits. The general qualities of MAP fruits were better than those of air stored fruits. Overall findings indicate that MAP was able to store mature green for 35 days without significant decreases in quality characteristics.

AB  - The research proved the capacity of mangrove soils (of Boca del Zorro Spout) to sorb and desorb two low molecular weight PAHs, fluorene and phenanthrene. In order to evaluate this capacity, we determined the total organic carbon (TOC wt%) and the maturity of soil organic matter (SOM) by calculating the maximum vitrinite reflectance (R (o) (max)). Additionally, batch-reactor experiments, water leaching and ultrasonication were conducted to study the sorption and desorption process. The mangrove soil presents a TOC content of 25% and a humification range of SOM that has reached the range of peat. Sorption isotherms were nonlinear following the Freundlich model. The values of the isotherm nonlinearity index (N) and organic carbon normalized sorption coefficients (log K-oc) are similar for fluorene and phenanthrene; therefore, they follow the same sorption mechanism in the mangrove soil. The log K-oc values obtained suggest that the soil is composed of a mixture of both recent organic matter and organic matter with an advanced degree of maturity. For this reason, for both polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the process responded to a non-linear model with limited sorption sites with variable potential energy. Both fluorene and phenanthrene presented a desorption percentage between 6-7% in mangrove soil sample. This allows us to infer that the bonds presented in the sorption process are associated with the insertion of fluorene and phenanthrene into the pores of the humified mangrove soil material. The research into mangrove soil displayed significant heterogeneity in composition and strong sorption of PAHs, as a result, mangrove soil presents natural filters in this area of the Venezuelan Caribbean.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the primary causes leading deaths worldwide. The presence of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries is the underlying pathophysiological basis of CAD, and accurate extraction of individual arterial branches using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is crucial for stenosis detection and CAD diagnosis. However, deep-learning-based models face challenges in generating semantic segmentation for coronary arteries due to the morphological similarity among different types of arteries. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach called the Edge Attention Graph Matching Network (EAGMN) for coronary artery semantic labeling. Inspired by the learning process of interventional cardiologists in interpreting ICA images, our model compares arterial branches between two individual graphs generated from different ICAs. We begin with extracting individual graphs based on the vascular tree obtained from the ICA. Each node in the individual graph represents an arterial segment, and the EAGMN aims to learn the similarity between nodes from the two individual graphs. By converting the coronary artery semantic segmentation task into a graph node similarity comparison task, identifying the node-to-node correspondence would assign semantic labels for each arterial branch. More specifically, the EAGMN utilizes the association graph constructed from the two individual graphs as input. A graph attention module is employed for feature embedding and aggregation, while a decoder generates the linear assignment for node-to-node semantic mapping. Based on the learned node-to-node relationships, unlabeled coronary arterial segments are classified using the labeled coronary arterial segments, thereby achieving semantic labeling. A dataset with 263 labeled ICAs is used to train and validate the EAGMN. Experimental results indicate the EAGMN achieved a weighted accuracy of 0.8653, a weighted precision of 0.8656, a weighted recall of 0.8653 and a weighted F1-score of 0.8643. Furthermore, we employ ZORRO to provide interpretability and explainability of the graph matching for artery semantic labeling. These findings highlight the potential of the EAGMN for accurate and efficient coronary artery semantic labeling using ICAs. By leveraging the inherent characteristics of ICAs and incorporating graph matching techniques, our proposed model provides a promising solution for improving CAD diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Objective: Inattentional blindness (IB) refers to an observer's failure to notice unexpected stimulus. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the priming type (perceptual, conceptual, and no priming) and emotional context (positive, negative, neutral) on IB with behavioral (IB, non-IB) and eye tracking measurements (latency of first fixation, total fixation time, and total fixation count in response to unexpected stimuli).
   Methods: A total of 193 volunteered male university students were invited in the study. Three thematic videos (positive, negative, and neutral) were created to capture the IB. In the first stage, five pictures (a model dressed in different costumes Zorro as an unexpected stimulus, Vendetta, a judge, a doctor, and a worker) were shown to the participants for priming. In the second stage, a distractor task which involved 30 simple arithmetic operations were given. In the third stage, one of the thematic IB videos were shown to the participants, and then they answered the questions about those videos. Participants were assigned randomly to 9 different experimental conditions according to a 3 (Priming Type: Perceptual, Conceptual. No Priming) x 3 (Emotional Context: Positive, Negative, Neutral) factorial design. Finally, behavioral and eye tracking measurements were collected.
   Results: Main and interaction effects of priming type and emotional contexts were not significant in terms of the behavioral measures. In addition, there were no significant differences between types of priming for eye tracking measures. However, there were significant differences between types of emotional contexts in all eye tracking measurements. In the negative context, participants made less total fixation, and looked shorter to unexpected stimulus than positive and neutral contexts. In addition, non-notifiers made less total fixation, and looked at unexpected stimulus for a shorter time compared to notifiers.
   Conclusion: The fact of "looking without seeing" was again demonstrated experimentally. Priming and emotional context did not affect behavioral data, but eye movements were affected from the emotional context. Current findings showed a relation between emotion and attention.

AB  - In traditional lucky imaging (TLI), many consecutive images of the same scene are taken with a high frame-rate camera, and all but the sharpest images are discarded before constructing the final shift-and-add image. Here, we present an alternative image analysis pipeline - The Thresher - for these kinds of data, based on online multi-frame blind deconvolution. It makes use of all available data to obtain the best estimate of the astronomical scene in the context of reasonable computational limits; it does not require prior estimates of the point-spread functions in the images, or knowledge of point sources in the scene that could provide such estimates. Most importantly, the scene it aims to return is the optimum of a justified scalar objective based on the likelihood function. Because it uses the full set of images in the stack, The Thresher outperforms TLI in signal-to-noise ratio; as it accounts for the individual-frame PSFs, it does this without loss of angular resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on both simulated data and real Electron-Multiplying CCD images obtained at the Danish 1.54-m telescope (hosted by ESO, La Silla). We also explore the current limitations of the algorithm, and find that for the choice of image model presented here, non-linearities in flux are introduced into the returned scene. Ongoing development of the software can be viewed at hups://github.com/jah1994/TheThresher.

AB  - Corn is one of the agricultural products that has a lot of benefits, such as a staple food, vegetable oil, fodder, various snacks, and cornflour. The background of this research is the ineffectiveness of corn farmers in threshing corn seeds caused in the processing is still done manually. The purpose of this research was to obtain a design and threshing tool for corn seed that fit consumer needs. The results of this research are obtained dimensions of the corn thresher size tool with a height of 85 cm, a length of 50 cm and a width of 30 cm. To be adaptable environmental and not noisy, this corn thresher uses a 2800 rpm electric motor, so from the results of testing the corn thresher tool has a production capacity of 150 kg/hour. One of the advantages of this corn thresher, corn does not scatter because it is made the funnel, and the price under 1.5 million rupiahs.

AB  - The liver oils of six shallow-water shark species, silky (Carcharhinus falciformis), thresher (Alopias superciliosus), oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), blue (Prionace glauca), hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and salmon (Lamna ditropis) were analyzed with particular attention to the regioisomeric composition of triacylglycerols (TAG). The TAG compositions were analyzed by using an HPLC-evaporative light scattering detector and each molecular species identified by HPLC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrometry. Major lipid components of all sharks' oils were TAG ( 80 %) made up of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids at 26-40 % and 20-25 % docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Forty different molecular species were detected in the TAG fractions. TAG consisting of one palmitic acid, one DHA and one oleic acid (12.5-19.9 %) and TAG consisting of two palmitic acids and one DHA (8.4-15.4 %) were the predominant form while 30-50 % TAG molecular species were bound to one or more DHA. Distribution of fatty acids in the primary (sn-1 and sn-3) and secondary (sn-2) position of the glycerol backbones was examined by regiospecific analysis by using pancreatic lipase and it was found that DHA was preferentially positioned at sn-2. These findings greatly extend the utilization of shark liver oils in food productions and may have a significant impact on the future development of the fish oil industry.

AB  - ATP hydrolysis by bacterial and eukaryotic MutS activities is required for their function in mismatch correction, and two different models for the role of ATP in MutS function have been proposed. In the translocation model, based on study of bacterial MutS, ATP binding reduces affinity of the protein for a mismatch and activates secondary DNA binding sites that are subsequently used for movement of the protein along the helix contour in a reaction dependent on nucleotide hydrolysis (Allen, D. J., Makhov, A., Grilley, M., Taylor, J., Thresher, R., Modrich, P., and Griffith, J. D. (1997) EMBO J. 16, 4467-4476). The molecular switch model, based on study of human MutS alpha, invokes mismatch recognition by the MutS alpha ADP complex. After recruitment of downstream repair activities to the MutS alpha mismatch complex, ATP binding results in release of MutS alpha from the heteroduplex (Gradia, S., Acharya, S., and Fishel, R.(1997) Cell 91, 995-1005). To further clarify the function of ATP binding and hydrolysis in human MutSa action, we evaluated the effects of ATP, ADP, and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs on the lifetime of protein DNA complexes. All of these nucleotides were found to increase the rate of dissociation of MutS alpha from oligonucleotide heteroduplexes. These experiments also showed that ADP is not required for mismatch recognition by MutS alpha, but that the nucleotide alters the dynamics of formation and dissociation of specific complexes. Analysis of the mechanism of ATP-promoted dissociation of MutS alpha from a 200-base pair heteroduplex demonstrated that dissociation occurs at DNA ends in a reaction dependent on ATP hydrolysis, implying that release from this molecule involves movement of the protein along the helix contour as predicted for a translocation mechanism. In order to reconcile the relatively large rate of movement of MutS homologs along the helix with their modest rate of ATP hydrolysis, we propose a novel mechanism for protein translocation along DNA that supports directional movement over long distances with minimal energy input.

AB  - The long-term effectiveness of acoustic pingers in reducing marine mammal bycatch was assessed for the swordfish and thresher shark drift gillnet fishery in California. Between 1990 and 2009, data on fishing gear, environmental variables, and bycatch were recorded for over 8,000 fishing sets by at-sea fishery observers, including over 4,000 sets outfitted with acoustic pingers between 1996 and 2009. Bycatch rates of cetaceans in sets with >= 30 pingers were nearly 50% lower compared to sets without pingers (p = 1.2 x 10(-6)), though this result is driven largely by common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) bycatch. Beaked whales have not been observed entangled in this fishery since 1995, the last full year of fishing without acoustic pingers. Pinger failure (>= 1 nonfunctioning pingers in a net) was noted in 3.7% of observed sets. In sets where the number of failed pingers was recorded, approximately 18% of deployed pingers had failed. Cetacean bycatch rates were 10 times higher in sets where >= 1 pingers failed versus sets without pinger failure (p = 0.002), though sample sizes for sets with pinger failure were small. No evidence of habituation to pingers by cetaceans was apparent over a 14-year period of use. Bycatch rates of California sea lions in sets with >= 30 gingers were nearly double that of sets without pingers, which prompted us to examine the potential "dinner bell" effects of pingers. Depredation of swordfish catch by California sea lions was not linked to pinger use-the best predictors of depredation were total swordfish catch, month fished, area fished, and nighttime use of deck lights on vessels.

AB  - Many of the world's shark populations are in decline, indicating the need for improved conservation and management. Well managed and appropriately located marine parks and marine protected areas (MPAs) have potential to enhance shark conservation by restricting fisheries and protecting suitable habitat for threatened shark populations. Here, we used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries to determine suitable habitat for pelagic sharks within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and to quantify the amount of suitable habitat contained within existing MPAs. We developed generalised linear models using proportional occurrences of pelagic sharks for three families: Alopiidae (thresher), Carcharhinidae (requiem), and Lamnidae (mackerel) sharks. We also considered aggregated species from the Lamnidae and Carcharhinidae families ('combined sharks' in the models). Using a set of environmental predictors known to affect shark occurrence, including chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, sea surface temperature, and turbidity, as well as geomorphological, geophysical, and sedimentary parameters, we found that models including sea surface temperature and turbidity were ranked highest in their ability to predict shark distributions. We used these results to predict geographic regions where habitat was most suitable for pelagic sharks within the Australian EEZ, and our results revealed that suitable habitat was limited in no-take zones within MPAs. For all shark groupings, suitable habitats were found mostly at locations exposed to fishing pressure, potentially increasing the vulnerability of the pelagic shark species considered. Our predictive models provide a foundation for future spatial planning and shark management, suggesting that strong fisheries management in addition to MPAs is necessary for pelagic shark conservation.

AB  - Unwanted bycatch of sea turtles in the tuna fisheries is a global challenge. To evaluate whether the incidental catch of sea turtles could be reduced through changes in fishing gear, this study compared catch rates and bycatch in the tuna pole-and-line with the addition of above-water lights (PL) fisheries using a Japan tuna hook (JT-hook) and a circle-shaped hook (C-hook). There were two phases to this study. First, five PL fishing vessels that used traditional JT-hooks were compared with five PL fishing vessels that used circle-shaped hooks throughout 1 full year of fishing. Results showed that C-hooks significantly reduced bycatch of sea turtle, while negligibly increasing the catch of yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tuna. Second, we conducted the onboard research to investigate the effect of JT-hook v. C-hook on the catch rates of commercial PL fishery. Results showed that there were higher catch rates of long snouted lancefish (Alepisaurus ferox) and wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), but lower catches of thresher shark (Alopias spp.) on C-hooks, with no significant differences for other species considered. Our results suggest that the use of C-hooks in the PL fishery is beneficial to protected endangered sea turtle species.

AB  - On 9th September 2015 the head of a shark belonging to the genus Alopias, was landed at Camogli harbour in the Ligurian Sea (North Western Mediterranean). The specimen has been caught 16 miles far from the coast (44 degrees 06' N, 008 degrees 57' E) as by-catch of the mesopelagic swordfish longline, but only the head was recovered, due to the predatory/ scavenging activity by other shark specimens. The specimen was a female of big-eye thresher shark Alopias superciliosus a highly migratory species worldwide distributed in tropical and temperate waters but rarely caught in the Mediterranean Sea. The present record is the northenmost reported for this species in the Mediterranean area and the sixth in Italian waters

AB  - The decline in traditionally valuable fish stocks, coupled with an increased demand for shark fins and meat has caused many fishermen to target sharks. However, there is limited information on the fishing practices, gears, and catch distribution for the shark fisheries. This study used a semi-structured interview to characterize the shark fisheries and techniques used to catch sharks as well as the catch statistics and trade in fifteen coastal communities along the Eastern, Central, and Western coasts of Ghana. Out of the 470 fishers interviewed, 46% were specialized shark fishers while the remaining 54% landed sharks as bycatch. Specialized shark fishers captured between 7-10 individual sharks per fishing trip while by-catch shark fishers captured between 1-5 sharks. The shark species harvested include the blue shark, thresher shark, common and sand tiger, bull shark, short and longfin mako shark, hammerhead, and milk shark. Fishers along the eastern coast mostly capture sharks as bycatch, while those along the central and western coast of Ghana target sharks with specialized fishing gears. The catch data obtained from the fishers indicated higher shark landings and was linked to the development of longlines and drift gill nets with hooks attached to the footrope that target sharks, and are usually deployed along the western coastlines of Ghana. Nearly all the shark species captured in the study communities were listed by the IUCN as either "Endangered ", "Critically Endangered " or "Vulnerable ". Among fishers who target sharks, 74% stated that shark populations were declining and were spending more effort to capture the fish. Specialized shark fishers indicated a poor perception and attitude towards shark conservation along the entire coastline of the country and are not in support of shark conservation. It is recommended that the capture and trade in these species should be closely monitored to prevent the extinction of vulnerable populations.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context. In the age of JWST, temperate terrestrial exoplanets transiting nearby late-type M dwarfs provide unique opportunities for characterising their atmospheres, as well as searching for biosignature gases. In this context, the benchmark TRAPPIST-1 planetary system has garnered the interest of a broad scientific community.
   Aims. We report here the discovery and validation of two temperate super-Earths transiting LP 890-9 (TOI-4306, SPECULOOS-2), a relatively low-activity nearby (32 pc) M6V star. The inner planet, LP 890-9 b, was first detected by TESS (and identified as TOI-4306.01) based on four sectors of data. Intensive photometric monitoring of the system with the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory then led to the discovery of a second outer transiting planet, LP 890-9 c (also identified as SPECULOOS-2 c), previously undetected by TESS. The orbital period of this second planet was later confirmed by MuSCAT3 follow-up observations.
   Methods. We first inferred the properties of the host star by analyzing its Lick/Kast optical and IRTF/SpeX near-infrared spectra, as well as its broadband spectral energy distribution, and Gaia parallax. We then derived the properties of the two planets by modelling multi-colour transit photometry from TESS, SPECULOOS-South, MuSCAT3, ExTrA, TRAPPIST-South, and SAINT-EX. Archival imaging, Gemini-South/Zorro high-resolution imaging, and Subaru/IRD radial velocities also support our planetary interpretation.
   Results. With a mass of 0.118 +/- 0.002 M-circle dot, a radius of 0.1556 +/- 0.0086 R-circle dot, and an effective temperature of 2850 +/- 75 K, LP 890-9 is the second-coolest star found to host planets, after TRAPPIST-1. The inner planet has an orbital period of 2.73 d, a radius of 1.320 (+0.053)(-0.027) R-circle plus, and receives an incident stellar flux of 4.09 +/- 0.12 S-circle plus. The outer planet has a similar size of 1.367 (+0.055)(-0.039) R-circle plus and an orbital period of 8.46 d. With an incident stellar flux of 0.906 +/- 0.026 S-circle plus, it is located within the conservative habitable zone, very close to its inner limit (runaway greenhouse). Although the masses of the two planets remain to be measured, we estimated their potential for atmospheric characterisation via transmission spectroscopy using a mass-radius relationship and found that, after the TRAPPIST-1 planets, LP 890-9 c is the second-most favourable habitable-zone terrestrial planet known so far (assuming for this comparison a similar atmosphere for all planets).
   Conclusions. The discovery of this remarkable system offers another rare opportunity to study temperate terrestrial planets around our smallest and coolest neighbours.

AB  - The pelagic thresher shark, Alopias pelagicus, like most large sharks produces a low number of offspring (two embryos per litter). However, there is no accurate information on its population status. To improve the accuracy of population simulations, a stochastic stage-based birth-flow model was constructed to assess the stock status of the pelagic thresher in the north-western Pacific. Based on the best biological information available, its life history was represented as four stages: neonates, juveniles, subadults, and adults. Results indicated that, without mortality from fishing, the stock would clearly increase (mean annual population growth rate (lambda) = 1.058 year(-1), 95% CI = 1.014-1.102 year(-1)). When current fishing mortality was taken into account, a decrease in population was indicated (lambda = 0.979 year(-1), 95% CI = 0.921-1.030 year(-1)) with a projected reduction of 34.3% over 20 years. These results suggest that the stock is overexploited. Simulations using various management measures showed that the population will remain steady under these protection options. However, this species is extremely vulnerable to overexploitation and is especially sensitive at the juvenile and adult stages, implying that nursery closures or size limit management measures are urgently needed to ensure the sustainable utilisation of the stock.

AB  - Since a combined harvester's grain-cleaning method depends on the pneumatic separation of grain and chaff, the airflow's aerodynamic forces significantly affect cleaning efficiency. Based on buckwheat's theoretical and mechanical properties, a new threshing drum with cleaning key parts was developed to reduce the variability of cleaning efficiency of buckwheat community threshers caused by inefficient threshing and accumulation of residue within the threshing system. This cleaning arrangement includes two wind speed inlets, each composed of four thin pipes of the same length as the threshing drum. The computational fluid dynamics modelling approach simulated the threshing and cleaning performance at different wind velocities within the threshing unit. The results showed that when the two inlets work simultaneously and adopt different wind speeds, i.e., 12 m/s and 15 m/s, the wind speed is higher than the critical value of the floating rate buckwheat kernel. Under this condition, the wind speed inlet area was increased, and the flow field velocity between the threshing drum and the concave grid plate ranged from 3.8 m/s-8.3 m/s. The flow velocity below the plate ranged from 7 m/s-15 m/s, higher than the floating speed of buckwheat kernels, which was the best choice. Based on these simulation results, a centrifugal fan was designed, which meets the buckwheat thresher's cleaning performance.

AB  - Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) is an important perennial medicinal and aromatic plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. Rosemary is widely produced in Turkey for its oil which can be extracted from the plants when flowers are in buds. In Turkey, a significant amount of domestic and foreign trade of rosemary is conducted. In 2018-2020, 2088 t of rosemary plants were imported, while in the same years 2077 t were exported. In this study, the performance indexes of a threshing and separating unit designed according to the physicomechanical properties of the rosemary were determined. The operating parameters of the machine were determined at three different moisture contents and adjusted according to the harvest moisture values. The threshing efficiency, work efficiency, power requirement, and specific energy consumption values of the threshing unit were determined, while separating efficiency, work efficiency and specific power consumption of separating unit of the developed system were determined. According to the study results, the threshing efficiency of the rosemary plant varied between 44.00% and 96.97%. Work efficiency of the thresher varied between 1.18 and 15.34 kg/h. Power requirements and specific energy consumption of the threshing unit were obtained as 0.19-1.05 kW and 0.02-0.37 kW center dot h/h, respectively. On the other hand, the separating efficiency of the separating unit for the rosemary plant varied between 44.27% and 85.24%. Maximum and minimum values of work efficiency were found as 0.75 kg/h and 5.52 kg/h. Specific power consumption of the unit ranged from 3.95 to 39.95 kW/kg.

AB  - Objective: Agricultural hand injuries occur mainly among young adults, many affecting the dominant hand, thereby impeding patients' ability to work or cope with social obligations. This study was carried out with the aim of collecting data on the epidemiology and management of agricultural hand injuries in Indian subjects.
   Method: The study was conducted in the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, JN Medical College, AMU, Aligarh, India, from October 2009 to December 2013. Patients with agricultural hand injuries were included. Data collected included socio-demographic details, mode and type of injury, type of reconstruction, complications, length of hospital stay and assessment of post-reconstruction status. These data were tabulated and analysed.
   Results: The typical patient was young (mean 33.2 years), of lower socio-economic status and with a total disregard for safety regulations. There is clustering of cases during the wheat harvest season (April-June). Wheat thresher injuries were the most common cause of partial hand amputation (51%), especially during this season. This was followed by fodder cutting (kutti/chara) machine injury, especially in females and children (36%). A simple classification for these injuries has been described and Grade II injury was the commonest. Reverse radial forearm flap was the most suitable regional flap for coverage, whereas thoraco-umbilical flap was the most commonly used distant flap. Patients who had the single-stage procedure had a significantly shorter stay.
   Conclusion: Agricultural hand injuries are not totally avoidable and their incidence can be reduced by proper education, but the low economic and literacy status of the patients is a big hurdle. The forearm offers many flaps for reconstruction of hand, which can be used in defects on dorsal or palmar aspect of hand and results in early discharge from the hospital and early rehabilitation. In patients with associated injury to the forearm, abdominal flaps can be used for cover.

AB  - Composite spectrum (CS) is a data-fusion technique that reduces the number of spectra to be analyzed, simplifying the analysis process for machine monitoring and fault detection. In this work, vibration signals from five components of a combine harvester (thresher, chopper, straw walkers, sieve box, and engine) are obtained by placing four accelerometers along the combine-harvester chassis in non-optimal locations. Four individual spectra (one from each accelerometer) and three CS (non-coherent, coherent and poly-coherent spectra) from 18 cases are analyzed. The different cases result from the combination of three working conditions of the components-deactivated (off), balanced (healthy), and unbalanced (faulty)-and two speeds-idle and maximum revolutions per minute (RPM). The results showed that (i) the peaks can be identified in the four individual spectra that correspond to the rotational speeds of the five components in the analysis; (ii) the three formulations of the CS retain the relevant information from the individual spectra, thereby reducing the number of spectra required for monitoring and detecting rotating unbalances within a combine harvester; and, (iii) data noise reduction is observed in coherent and poly-coherent CS with respect to the non-coherent CS and the individual spectra. This study demonstrates that the rotating unbalances of various components within agricultural machines, can be detected with a reduced number of accelerometers located in non-optimal positions, and that it is feasible to simplify the monitoring with CS. Overall, the coherent CS may be the best composite spectra formulation in order to monitor and detect rotating unbalances in agricultural machines.

AB  - Best-quality seeds of high-yielding commercial cultivars are the foundation of the future harvest in all crops. Significant seed damage arises from seed injury during harvesting and tillage. With the use of machinery in all harvesting and processing stages, the issue of seed injury has become severe. Therefore, the presented research sought to determine commercial soybean seeds' properties and seeding qualities, depending on the cultivar properties and the influence of machinery used in harvesting. The identified degree of soybean seed injury of commercial soybean cultivars depends on the growing strength after harvesting with drum threshing combined with the harvesting equipment's influence. Based on biological characteristics, the soybean cultivars differed significantly in the number of damaged seeds during harvest using the drum thresher type 'Sampo SR 2035'. However, the soybean cultivar Birlik KV showed the minimum seed damage (49.5%), whereas the cultivar Zhansaya had the most seed injuries (83.0%). According to laboratory tests, high intensity of initial growth resulted in seeds of soybean cultivars Birlik KV (86.0%), followed by Perizat (82.0%), and Lastochka (78.0%). Seeds of the soybean cultivars Ivushka and Zhansaya had the lowest growth strength (52.0%-60.0%). The most injury-prone soybean cultivar Zhansaya exhibited 21.3% crushed and inured seeds when their threshing used a drum thresher, but when threshed with a rotary thresher, the number of damaged seeds decreased to 2.9%. For injury-resistant soybean cultivar Lastochka, the harvester Sampo SR 2035 produced 12.4% injured seeds, and the harvester 'John Deere' generated 2.2% crushed seeds.

AB  - ATP hydrolysis by MutS homologs is required for function of these proteins in mismatch repair. However, the function of ATP hydrolysis in the repair reaction is controversial. In this paper we describe a steady-state kinetic analysis of the DNA-activated ATPase of human MutS alpha. Comparison of salt concentration effects on mismatch repair and mismatch-provoked excision in HeLa nuclear extracts with salt effects on the DNA-activated ATPase suggests that ATP hydrolysis by MutS alpha is involved in the rate determining step in the repair pathway. While the ATPase is activated by homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA, the half-maximal concentration for activation by heteroduplex DNA is significantly lower under physiological salt concentrations. Furthermore, at optimal salt concentration, heteroduplex DNA increases the k(cat) for ATP hydrolysis to a greater extent than does homoduplex DNA, We also demonstrate that the degree of ATPase activation is dependent on DNA chain length, with the k(cat) for hydrolysis increasing significantly with chain length of the DNA cofactor. These results are discussed in terms of the translocation (Allen, D, J,, Makhov, A., Grilley, M,, Taylor, J,, Thresher, R,, Modrich, P,, and Griffith, J, D, (1997) EMBO J, 16, 4467-4476) and the molecular switch (Gradia, S,, Acharya, S,, and Fishel, R, (1997) Cell 91, 995-1005) models that invoke distinct roles for ATP hydrolysis in MutS homolog function.

KW  - TOXICITY
AB  - Background: Methylmercury (CH3Hg) toxicity causes irreversible inhibition of selenium (Se)-dependent enzymes, including those that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in the brain. Fish consumption provides numerous essential nutrients required for optimal health, but is also associated with CH3Hg exposure risks, especially during fetal development. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the amounts of both elements in seafood to evaluate relative risks or benefits. Consumption of ocean fish containing Se in molar excess of CH3Hg will prevent interruption of selenoenzyme activities, thereby alleviating Hg-exposure risks. Because dietary Se is a pivotal determinant of CH3Hg's effects, the Selenium Health Benefit Value (HBV) criterion was developed to predict risks or benefits as a result of seafood consumption. A negative HBV indicates Hg is present in molar excess of Se and may impair Se availability while a positive HBV indicates consumption will improve the Se status of the consumer, thus negating risks of Hg toxicity.
   Objective: This study examined the Hg and Se contents of varieties of seafood to establish those with positive HBV's offering benefits and those having negative HBVs indicating potential consumption risks.
   Methods: The Hg and Se molar concentrations in samples of meat from pilot whale, mako shark, thresher shark, swordfish, bigeye tuna, and skipjack tuna were used to determine their HBV's in relation to body weight.
   Results: The HBVs of pilot whale, mako shark, and swordfish were typically negative and inversely related to body weight, indicating their consumption may impair Se availability. However, the HBV's of thresher shark, bigeye tuna, and skipjack tuna were uniformly positive regardless of body weights, indicating their consumption counteracts Hg-dependent risks of selenoenzyme impairment.
   Conclusions: The HBV criterion provides a reliable basis for differentiating seafoods whose intake should be limited during pregnancy from those that should be consumed to obtain health benefits.

AB  - Scientific data collected by Japanese tuna longline research and training vessels during 1967-1970 and 1992-1995 were used for analyses of the historical change in species composition of pelagic sharks and CPUE by species between the two periods in the four areas into which the area 0 degrees-20 degrees N & 140 degrees E-140 degrees W in the Pacific Ocean were divided equally. To examine the long-term change of shark abundance, CPUE for sharks combined (total shark) was also analyzed from 1973 to 1993 which covered the majority of the missing period between the two periods. Blue shark Prionace glauca was the dominant species in these areas and the shark species composition in number changed somewhat in these areas between the two periods. Nominal CPUE of oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus and silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis decreased in three areas and that of thresher sharks Alopias spp. increased in all areas. However, levels of the CPUE adjusted with the effect of gear type did not change remarkably between the two periods, CPUE of total shark did not indicate any tendency in these areas from 1973 to 1993. Considering that there was no appreciable change in abundance of blue shark between the two periods or of total shark in the interim period between 1973 and 1993, the abundance of blue shark were inferred not to have changed significantly in these areas from 1968 to 1995.

AB  - Advances in animal tag technologies now offer a significant method for gathering oceanographic information throughout the world's oceans. By employing marine organisms as oceanic samplers (MOOS), vast amounts of in situ data (e.g. temperature, productivity and salinity In relation to depth and location) can be archived and transmitted via satellite or obtained directly from the tag if the tag is recovered. The beauty of this technique is that no on-board navigation system nor external propulsion supply Is required. The animal performs the work necessary to transport the equipment and chooses what transect to run. The gathered data, guided by the animal's point of view, reveal secrets of the animal's life and pinpoint environmental features most important to its lifestyle. Depending on the species tagged, the animal may perform a number of tasks of great interest to oceanographers e.g. gathering data from remote regions like the poles, performing repeated deep dives, targeting specific food sources or oceanographic features and traversing massive expanses of ocean. The breadth of animal species with which this technology has been successfully deployed is growing steadily. The list Includes bluefin and yellowfin tuna, white sharks, thresher sharks, whale sharks, ocean sunfish, marine turtles, seals, sea lions, and seabirds. It is hoped that the wealth of tag data already being collected worldwide can serve both the needs of the biologic and oceanographic communities alike.

AB  - During harvesting, the thresher of the combine harvester produces unbalanced vibrations due to problems such as stalk winding and these can greatly affect the stability and service life of the device. Finite element modal analysis and the vibration tests of the threshing cylinder and the frame were carried out. Based on the simulation of the thresher and the analysis of experimental data, four kinds of prestressed support beams were designed to suppress the dynamic characteristics of the thresher during operation. To verify the vibration suppression effect, a vibration test was carried out with the prestressed support beams on installed on the thresher. The results showed that vibration of the threshing device is intensified during threshing and the vibration is mainly transmitted to the entire machine frame through the bearing seats. The four prestressed support beams designed can all can provide dynamic suppression of the threshing device but the triangular beam had the best restraining effect. Thus, properly designed prestressed support beam structures can effectively suppress the dynamic characteristics produced by the thresher during the threshing process. ? 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Protective effects of selenium against mercury toxicity have been demonstrated in all animal models evaluated. As interactions between selenium and mercury and their molar ratios in seafood are essential factors in evaluating risks associated with dietary mercury exposure, considering mercury content alone is inadequate. In this study, the absolute and molar concentrations of mercury and selenium were determined in edible portions from 420 individual fish representing 15 species of pelagic fish collected from the central North Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. Selenium was in molar excess of mercury in almost all fish species evaluated. The rank order of mean Se/Hg molar ratios was striped marlin (17.6)> yellowfin tuna (14.1)> mahimahi (13.1)> skipjack tuna (12.8)> spearfish (11.4)> wahoo (10.8)> sickle pomfret (6.7)> albacore tuna (5.3)> bigeye tuna (5.2)> blue marlin (4.1)> escolar (2.4)> opah (2.3)> thresher shark (1.5)> swordfish (1.2)> mako shark (0.5). With a Se/Hg molar ratio of less than 1, mako shark was the only fish containing a net molar excess of mercury. A selenium health benefit value based on the absolute amounts and relative proportions of selenium and mercury in seafood is proposed as a more comprehensive seafood safety criterion.

AB  - The hunting strategies of pelagic thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus) were investigated at Pescador Island in the Philippines. It has long been suspected that thresher sharks hunt with their scythe-like tails but the kinematics associated with the behaviour in the wild are poorly understood. From 61 observations recorded by handheld underwater video camera between June and October 2010, 25 thresher shark shunting events were analysed. Thresher sharks employed tail-slaps to debilitate sardines at all times of day. Hunting events comprised preparation, strike, wind-down recovery and prey item collection phases, which occurred sequentially. Preparation phases were significantly longer than the others, presumably to enable a shark to windup a tail-slap. Tail-slaps were initiated by an adduction of the pectoral fins, a manoeuvre that changed a thresher shark's pitch promoting its posterior region to lift rapidly, and stall its approach. Tail-slaps occurred with such force that they may have caused dissolved gas to diffuse out of the water column forming bubbles. Thresher sharks were able to consume more than one sardine at a time, suggesting that tail-slapping is an effective foraging strategy for hunting schooling prey. Pelagic thresher sharks appear to pursue sardines opportunistically by day and night, which may make them vulnerable to fisheries. Alopiids possess specialist pectoral and caudal fins that are likely to have evolved, at least in part, for tail-slapping. The evidence is now clear; thresher sharks really do hunt with their tails.

AB  - The Peruvian sea represents one of the most productive ocean ecosystems and possesses one of the largest elasmobranch fisheries in the Pacific Ocean. Ecosystem-based management of these fisheries will require information on the trophic ecology of elasmobranchs. This study aimed to understand the diet, trophic interactions and the role of nine commercial elasmobranch species in northern Peru through the analysis of stomach contents. A total of 865 non-empty stomachs were analysed. Off northern Peru, elasmobranchs function as upper-trophic-level species consuming 78 prey items, predominantly teleosts and cephalopods. Two distinctive trophic assemblages were identified: (a) sharks (smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena, thresher shark Alopias spp. and blue shark Prionace glauca) that feed mainly on cephalopods in the pelagic ecosystem; and (b) sharks and batoids (Chilean eagle ray Myliobatis chilensis, humpback smooth-hound Mustelus whitneyi, spotted houndshark Triakis maculata, Pacific guitarfish Pseudobatos planiceps, copper shark Carcharhinus brachyurus and school shark Galeorhinus galeus) that feed mainly on teleosts and invertebrates in the benthonic and pelagic coastal ecosystem. This study reveals for the first time the diet of T. maculata and the importance of elasmobranchs as predators of abundant and commercial species (i.e., jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas and Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens). The results of this study can assist in the design of an ecosystem-based management for the northern Peruvian sea and the conservation of these highly exploited, threatened or poorly understood group of predators in one of the most productive marine ecosystems.

AB  - Male external genitalia injury with testicular loss is relatively uncommon in civilian practice. Testicular amputation is usually found with military trauma and self-mutilation. However, they do occur while operating machines for domestic purposes. The standard protocols for the management of traumatic testicular amputation are lacking. The management is focused on resuscitation of the patient and restoration of testicular function with acceptable cosmesis. Here, we present a case of a 45-year-old man with traumatic right testicular amputation while he was using a thresher for rice cutting.

AB  - The flagship of extrinsic allergic alveo-litis was, historically, farmer's lung, whose history can be traced back to the year 1500. Later, however, it turned out that allergic alveolitis from various dusts of birds and bed feathers is by far most common. Surprisingly, this was not discovered until 1960. The immunological processes with the precipitating IgG antibodies were detected in the 1960s primarily by J. Pepys in London. Later, more than 50 different clinical pictures have been described with this so-called type III allergy caused by bacteria, fungi, yeasts, plants, animals, and chemicals. Outstanding are indoor alveolitis and humidifier lung caused by humidifiers and air conditioning systems as well as misting fountains, steam irons, whirlpools, and wind instruments. From a clinical point of view, toxic alveolitides are confusingly similar to allergic alveolitis. Thus, thresher's lung is often confused with farmer's lung. For the toxic alveolitides from organic dusts such as hay, straw, cotton, flax, hemp, or jute dust, the term ODTS (organic dust toxic syndrome) has become established. In contrast to allergic alveolitis, ODTS does not lead to fibrosis of the lung and also lacks the high titer IgG antibodies typical for allergic alveolitis. Of the inorganic toxic alveolitides, metal fume fever has been known since 1832, the silo filler's disease since 1956, polymer smoke fever, on the other hand, only since the 1980s. These inorganic toxic alveolitides of toxic vapors, smokes, and gases are very heterogeneous, and their pathomechanisms are poorly understood.

AB  - The use of thresher machines for threshing rice plants helped farmers in improving agricultural productivity. However, thresher machine design that is currently available has not fairly concerned on the working position and posture of the farmers using it. The working position that was modeled by farmers when operating a thresher machine tent to cause injury because of the dimensions of the engine and the body of farmers that did not conform to each other. RULA method was one of the methods that could analyze work postures. From the results of the data collection and the process using RULA method, it was clear that the measures that had to be taken to the thresher machines which used to be available were promptly modified in order to avoid musculoskeletal problem. Improvements that could be undertaken to avoid the musculoskeletal problem on farmers who used the thresher machine were redesigning the thresher machine based on farmers working posture. One of these ways was by adjusting the dimensions of the farmers' body with the dimensions of the machine. In addition, the use of adjustable concept in the design could probably assist the farmers adjust the working position with the machinery they used.

AB  - The impact shelling of grains in the threshing drum leads to the generation of undamped vibration in the system. The induced vibration results in deformation of the rasp bar member at the concave section and produces disturbance in clearance gap. The mathematical modelling of the system is formulated on the basis of dynamic analysis at the concave section. The mathematical model representing the deformation due to dynamic impedance gives the deflection equation of the system. The 'matlab' simulation is performed on the mathematical model to trace the maximum deflection at the concave section. The simulator deflection is compared with the deformation obtained by finite element analysis. The finite element analysis is performed on the mechanical design model with structural static and dynamic loading. The mapping of the deflection coefficient gives the positive correction coefficient of 0. 9854. The deflection equation is programmed into the Arduino. The stress transducer records the deflection over the concave section and simulates the drive for auto-controlling the clearance gap. The real-time monitoring of deflection is noted and processed for controlling the thresher encoder motor. The interfacing of deflection equation imparts real-time controlling of threshing parameters &commits the highest efficiency. The proposed approach aims at providing solutions for the future of smart cities by minimizing crop residue and providing socio-economic opportunities.

AB  - In this paper, the whirl characteristics and instability of the thresher in a combined harvester subjected to stalk winding are investigated. Using the spinning Timoshenko beam assumptions, the governing equations of motion for the thresher-stalk system are obtained via Hamilton's principle. Considering the elastic end supports, the exact and approximated dimensionless whirl frequency equations are derived. On the basis of the obtained formulas, both whirl characteristics and stability of the thresher-stalk system are investigated numerically, and the validation of the present analysis is conducted by comparing with the results available in the literature. In addition, the effects of mode number, mass ratio, eccentric distance, shear deformation, and slenderness ratio on the critical spinning speed, stability, and instability boundary are deeply discussed. The results show that the whirl characteristics and stability of the thresher-stalk system are strongly dependent on the stalks wound around the thresher. (C) 2022 Author(s).

AB  - Wild oat is a herbicide resistance-prone global weed species that causes significant economic losses in dryland and horticultural agriculture. As a result, there has been a significant research effort to control this species. A major impediment to this research is the seed coat-mediated dormancy of wild oat, which requires a labor-intensive incision or puncturing of the seed coat to initiate seed germination. This study defines the most efficient settings of a mechanical thresher to overcome wild oat seed dormancy and then validates these settings using multiple populations collected from the Western Australian grain belt. We also compare the effects of rapid mechanical scarification and known germination stimulus tactics such as scarification with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), partial endosperm removal, sandpaper scarification of the seed coat, and immersion in sodium nitroprusside (NO donor SNP) solution on wild oat seedling growth rate. Threshing treatment of 1,500 rpm for 5 s provides equivalent germination compared with manually puncturing individual wild oat seeds, with no difference in seedling relative growth rate. The mechanical scarification of seeds using the thresher resulted in greater germination (66%) than H2SO4 scarification (0%), partial endosperm removal (10%), sandpaper seed coat scarification (25%), and exposure to NO donor SNP (34%).

AB  - Interactions between pelagic thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus) and cleaner wrasse were investigated at a seamount in the Philippines. Cleaning associations between sharks and teleosts are poorly understood, but the observable interactions seen at this site may explain why these mainly oceanic sharks regularly venture into shallow coastal waters where they are vulnerable to disturbance from human activity. From 1,230 hours of observations recorded by remote video camera between July 2005 and December 2009, 97 cleaner-thresher shark events were analyzed, 19 of which were interrupted. Observations of pelagic thresher sharks interacting with cleaners at the seamount were recorded at all times of day but their frequency declined gradually from morning until evening. Cleaners showed preferences for foraging on specific areas of a thresher shark's body. For all events combined, cleaners were observed to conduct 2,757 inspections, of which 33.9% took place on the shark's pelvis, 23.3% on the pectoral fins, 22.3% on the caudal fin, 8.6% on the body, 8.3% on the head, 2.1% on the dorsal fin, and 1.5% on the gills respectively. Cleaners did not preferentially inspect thresher sharks by time of day or by shark sex, but there was a direct correlation between the amount of time a thresher shark spent at a cleaning station and the number of inspections it received. Thresher shark clients modified their behavior by "circular-stance-swimming,'' presumably to facilitate cleaner inspections. The cleaner-thresher shark association reflected some of the known behavioral trends in the cleaner-reef teleost system since cleaners appeared to forage selectively on shark clients. Evidence is mounting that in addition to acting as social refuges and foraging grounds for large visiting marine predators, seamounts may also support pelagic ecology by functioning as cleaning stations for oceanic sharks and rays.

AB  - Oceanic sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation due to their life-history strategies, and efforts to protect them in the wild have been stalled by transjurisdictional conflicts of interest. The pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus) is one such species that visits a seamount in the Philippines where its dependable presence has catalysed a burgeoning dive tourism industry and the designation of a conservation area. Nothing is known of the range and turnover of this population, but the regularity with which these sharks interact with cleaner wrasse on the seamount provides important stability for regional businesses that lack empirical knowledge of their vulnerability. We fitted 14 pelagic thresher sharks with acoustic tags and monitored their fine scale movements for 66 days (June to mid-August 2014). Individuals were present at the seamount for 32% of their days at liberty, and 42% of the tagged sharks were still being detected there at the end of the study. Thresher sharks showed preferences for visiting specific locations on the seamount where they interact with cleaner fish, and estimates of their fidelity to these sites provided scalars for visual census. Pelagic thresher sharks moved away from the seamount after early morning visits to cleaning stations using swim speeds of 3.79 km h(-1) (+/- SD 1.43). These movements demonstrated that they have access to the jurisdictional waters of five provincial territories when dispersing from and returning to the seamount on a diurnal basis. While the seamount offers cleaner-associated services and refuge provision for pelagic thresher sharks, their scale of movement leaves them vulnerable to fisheries that operate in the region. Natural history observations provide context and reveal bias for their application in the management and conservation of this rare and vulnerable shark species.

T2  - SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Eight field bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars at both low (8-10%) and high (11-15%) seed moisture were threshed using six systems. These included a hand shelled control, flail threshing on a tarp over concrete or soil, flailing in sacks and two threshing machines, an Almaco small plot thresher and an Allesdrescher K thresher. Seed samples were examined for yield, fragments, testa cracks, rolled towel germination, and field emergence. Highest quality seed was produced by open flail threshing or hand shelling, and averaged 65% emergence in field plantings. Mechanical threshing reduced mean final stand to an average of 58%, but damage was much worse for large, dry seeds, with field emergence dropping as low as an average of 39% for kidney beans threshed at a seed moisture content of 8-10%. White seeded cultivars exhibited poorer emergence on the average (44%) than coloured seeded cultivars (80%), but this did not result from greater susceptibility to threshing injury. These findings indicate that where feasible, manual threshing methods are superior to mechanical methods for production of small lots of Phaseolus vulgaris seed.

AB  - This paper takes a drum type corn thresher as the research object. A 3-d discrete element method (DEM) numerical model of the thresher designed using 3-d CAD software is established. Subsequent numerical model of the corn ears is constructed based on the particle agglomeration method. On this basis, corn threshing analysis software has been developed using Visual Studio 2010. The effects of drum rotation rate and feeding amount on the corn ear threshing rate and number of separated corn kernels produced over the drum length are studied. Good agreement has been found between the numerical results and experimental data. As the drum rotation rate, and the feeding amount increase, the corn ear threshing rate increases, and the number of separated corn kernel decreases over the drum length. The feasibility and effectiveness of analysing the corn threshing process using DEM and the allied software are validated. (C) 2015 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

AB  - N-Nitrosamines have recently been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny, including the setting of low exposure limits (18 ng/day) (European Medicines Agency (EMA), 2020). This paper evaluates different methodologies to determine statistically robust bounds on the carcinogenic potency of chemical classes, using historic TD50 data (Peto et al., 1984; Thresher et al., 2019) and exemplified for N-nitrosamines. Initially, the distribution of TD50 values (TD(50)s) for N-nitrosamines of known potency was characterised. From this, it is possible to compare parametric and non-parametric methods to obtain percentiles of interest from the distribution of TD(50)s, which are shown to be robust to uncertainty in the initial TD50 estimates. These methods may then be applied to different chemical subclasses. The values obtained may be of use in refining acceptable intakes for N-nitrosamines and their subclasses.

AB  - In Ecuador, one of the main hazards for threatened marine species, such as sea turtles, is small-scale fisheries bycatch. At a global scale, currently, bycatch reduction technologies (BRTs) are being tested in many coastal nations to mitigate this issue. Despite some advances in Ecuadorian efforts for wildlife protection, BRTs to reduce bycatch have yet to be assessed. The purpose of this study was to test the BRT of net illumination using violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a mitigation measure to reduce sea turtle interactions in the small-scale driftnet fishery operating from the ports of Santa Rosa, Puerto Lopez and Jaramijo. A total of 146 pairs of experimental sets (control and illuminated panes) were deployed in all ports. A generalized linear mixed-effect model (GLIVIM) was employed to analyze the bycatch per unit of effort (BPUE) for sea turtles, and the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for target species; for both control and illuminated panes. Thirty-two sea turtles from three species were observed captured: olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea (n=18), green Chelonia mydas (n=13) and leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea (n=1). Turtle species-specific modeling showed bycatch of green turtles declined by 93% in illuminated nets compared with control, non-illuminated nets, whereas no significant difference between control and illuminated nets was observed for olive ridley turtles. The catch per unit effort of the pelagic fish species including skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna, mahi-mahi, thresher shark and smooth hammerhead shark was not affected by net illumination. Our results represent the first evaluation of the effects of net illumination using LEDs on reducing marine turtle bycatch in Ecuadorian small-scale driftnet fisheries. Despite its relatively small sample size, these results could be used by fisheries managers to support the implementation or further testing of this BRT in gillnet fisheries along the Ecuadorian coast.

AB  - The constitutive model of corn has an intense influence on the mechanical structure design and machine performance. In this paper, a creep property formula of corn-based on the Burgers model was proposed, which described the change process of the stress-strain trait of corn grain with time. Then, the mathematical model of the "corn-mechanical" interaction system was then established based on the Hertz-Mindlin no-slip model. The kinematic and dynamic formulas of corn ear under the action of threshers were deduced, and the "corn-corn" contact characteristics based on Hertz-Mindlin with bonding model were analyzed. Moreover, a new discrete element model construction method of the corn ear was proposed through particle filling and splicing methods. The simulation experiment was carried out in EDEM to verify the constitutive model and discrete element model of corn ear. The results showed that the particle filling model could better explain the mechanism of corn ear threshing and obtain the force of each corn grain during threshing. The average velocity of corn ear was 55.2 m/s, the maximum value was 216.7 m/s, and the minimum value was 16.2 m/s, while the average normal force was 201.7 N, the maximum force was 342.0 N, and the minimum force was 104.2 N respectively, it verified the feasibility and accuracy of models. Finally, the field experiment was carried out to verify the simulation results, and the corn grain broken rate was 2.16%. These results fill the blank of fundamental theoretical research on the design of corn ear threshing devices and provide a reference for the optimal design of other crop production equipment.

AB  - In Focus: Morrongiello, J. R., Sweetman, P. C., & Thresher, R. E. (2019). Fishing constrains phenotypic responses of marine fish to climate variability. Journal of Animal Ecology, 88, 1645-1656. Forces of unnatural selection, such as climate change and harvest, are rarely studied in concert, yet hold the great potential to act synergistically on individual performance, susceptibility to harvest, tolerance to warming temperatures, and ultimately population persistence and resilience. In this paper, Morrongiello et al. (2019) used long-term monitoring of a site-attached temperate reef fish, the purple wrasse (Notolabrus fucicola), to test novel predictions about how fisheries management and climate variability could alter individual growth rates and thermal reaction norms within and across stocks. Otolith growth increments were collected from three south-east Australian populations between 1980 and 1999, pre- and post-harvest, throughout an intensive warming spell. Using hierarchical models to partition variation in growth within and between individuals and populations, Morrongiello et al. detected increased average growth rate with warming, a release from density dependence post-harvest, and a fishing-by-warming interaction that decreased diversity in thermal growth reaction norms because large individuals that tend to better tolerate warm temperatures were effectively culled from the population. This study outlines the importance of determining which phenotypes are more resilient to increasing temperatures, how fisheries should manage for them, and how such collective knowledge could help preserve and even promote resilience of managed populations to increasing temperatures in ecosystems threatened by climate change.

AB  - Background: Cluster analysis is the most common unsupervised method for finding hidden groups in data. Clustering presents two main challenges: (1) finding the optimal number of clusters, and (2) removing "outliers" among the objects being clustered. Few clustering algorithms currently deal directly with the outlier problem. Furthermore, existing methods for identifying the number of clusters still have some drawbacks. Thus, there is a need for a better algorithm to tackle both challenges.
   Results: We present a new approach, implemented in an R package called Thresher, to cluster objects in general datasets. Thresher combines ideas from principal component analysis, outlier filtering, and von Mises-Fisher mixture models in order to select the optimal number of clusters. We performed a large Monte Carlo simulation study to compare Thresher with other methods for detecting outliers and determining the number of clusters. We found that Thresher had good sensitivity and specificity for detecting and removing outliers. We also found that Thresher is the best method for estimating the optimal number of clusters when the number of objects being clustered is smaller than the number of variables used for clustering. Finally, we applied Thresher and eleven other methods to 25 sets of breast cancer data downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus; only Thresher consistently estimated the number of clusters to lie in the range of 4-7 that is consistent with the literature.
   Conclusions: Thresher is effective at automatically detecting and removing outliers. By thus cleaning the data, it produces better estimates of the optimal number of clusters when there are more variables than objects. When we applied Thresher to a variety of breast cancer datasets, it produced estimates that were both self-consistent and consistent with the literature. We expect Thresher to be useful for studying a wide variety of biological datasets.

AB  - The pelagic thresher, Alopias pelagicus, plays a vital role in coastal and marine ecosystems as a top predator that feeds on species from low trophic levels. It is a commercial species relevant in Ecuador. The feeding chain of A. pelagicus was analyzed through carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in the Southeast Pacific Ocean. Considering the lack of studies regarding this topic, this would elucidate the flow of nutrients and energy from the base up to this predator. Its diet composition included 19 prey species, out of which 10 were cephalopods and nine Osteichthyes. The most relevant species were the squid Ommastrephes bartramii, Dosidicus gigas, Stenoteuthis oualaniensis, and the fish Merluccius gayi peruanus. The pelagic thresher is a carnivore predator, and its prey species belong to tertiary and quaternary trophic levels. The carbon and nitrogen male isotopic ratios were similar to those of females, as were immature and mature organisms. This suggests that this species feeds in oceanic regions of low depths and could be exploiting and sharing an area with similar feeding resources. According to the mixing models, squids were the most important prey group, in which the squid Ommastrephes bartramii contributed most to its diet. Furthermore, this shark was characterized as a specialist predator with a trophic overlap by sex and maturity stages.

AB  - We used acoustic telemetry to investigate the roles of depth and temperature in the daytime foraging behaviours of 13 tagged pelagic thresher sharks by monitoring their fine scale vertical movements in the Philippines. Cumulatively, pelagic thresher shark dives traversed the entire water column where they encountered temperatures that ranged from 33 degrees C at the surface to 12 degrees C at 250 m depths throughout the day, but the movements of individuals varied in the extent of both their deep and shallow water limits. Dives were not synchronized to diurnal cycles, and periodicity reflected cycles of similar dives, the dives themselves, deviations, cruising, and individuality. Pelagic thresher shark movements between the warm surface layer and cooler waters below the thermocline (155 - 175 m) may reflect a common Alopiid strategy that balances maintaining tolerable ambient water temperatures with opportunities to search for and forage on spatially patchy distributions of prey.

AB  - The pelagic thresher shark is among the most heavily exploited shark species in the commercial fisheries of the tropical Indo-Pacific oceans. Despite this severe exploitation, little is known about pelagic thresher population dynamics, particularly the species' life history traits, and overall stock status. The pelagic thresher exhibits slow growth and extremely low fecundity, indicating the need for reassessment of the population status of this globally threatened shark. Because information on catch and effort of this bycatch species is scarce, several data-limited methods-quantitative demographic methods, per-recruit analysis, and risk assessment-were employed in this study to provide an accurate measurement of the status of pelagic thresher shark stocks. For each sex, the composite risk assessments indicated that the probability of the current fishing mortality increasing beyond any level of yield-per-recruit (YPR) was approximately zero given the biological reference points (BRPs). Moreover, the current spawning potential ratio (SPR) was found to be significantly below the target reference point of SPR60%, but slightly above the limit reference point of SPR40%. However, because SPR-based BRPs are much less sensitive to input parameter uncertainties than YPR-based BRPs, results derived from the SPR model are more suitable for species management. Management strategy simulations based on demographic two-sex models indicated that without mortality from fishing, female pelagic threshers have a higher population growth rate than males. However, the stock status of female pelagic thresher shark is poorer than that of males under current conditions. The findings suggest that sex-specific management decisions must be made to achieve the sustainable utilization of this species. Overall, both the sex-specific per-recruit and demographic models determined that recruitment overfishing has occurred in the female pelagic thresher population of the Northwest Pacific Ocean, indicating that close monitoring of female sharks is urgent and necessary to ensure that stocks remain sustainable.

AB  - Current corn kernel-cob bonding mechanics models (LSD models) uniformly consider the bonding force changes during the maize threshing operation as an elastic change, resulting in computational errors of up to 10% or more in discrete element simulations. Due to the inability to perform high-precision discrete element simulation of the mechanics characteristics during the corn threshing operation, the core operating parameters of the corn thresher (rotation speed of the threshing component) rely mainly on empirical settings, resulting in a consistent difficulty in exceeding 85% of the corn ear threshing rate. In this paper, by testing the mechanics characteristics of corn kernels, the bonding force is found to have both elastic and plastic changes during the threshing process. An elastic-plastic (EP) damping model of the corn kernel-cob bonding force was established by introducing a bonding restitution coefficient e to achieve an integrated consideration of the two changes. By testing the relationship between the properties of the corn ear itself and the model parameters, the pattern of the effect of the corn ear moisture content and the loading direction of the ear by force on the EP model parameters was found. By establishing a model of the relationship between the corn cob's own properties and the model parameters, the EP model parameter values can be determined by simply determining the moisture content of the ear. In this paper, the EP model was established and the high-precision simulation and analysis of the process of bonding force variation between corn kernel and cob is realized on the self-developed AgriDEM software. At the meantime, the optimal values of the threshing component rotation speed under different conditions of moisture content of corn ear were obtained by establishing an optimization model of threshing component rotation speed. The test results showed that the corn ear threshing rate could reach more than 92.40% after adopting the optimized speed value of the threshing component in this paper. Meanwhile, the test results showed that the discrete element simulation results based on the EP model did not significantly differ from the measured results of the thresher. Compared with the most widely used LSD model, the EP model can reduce the computational error by 3.35% to 6.05%.

AB  - The pelagic thresher shark Alopias pelagicus is an understudied elasmobranch harvested in commercial fisheries of the tropical Indo-Pacific. The species is endangered, overexploited throughout much of its range, and has a decreasing population trend. Relatively little is known about its movement ecology, precluding an informed recovery strategy. Here, we report the first results from an individual pelagic thresher shark outfitted with a pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tag to assess its movement with respect to the species' physiology and trophic ecology. A 19 d deployment in the Red Sea revealed that the shark conducted normal diel vertical migration, spending the majority of the day at 200-300min the mesopelagic zone and the majority of the night at 50-150 m in the epipelagic zone, with the extent of these movements seemingly not constrained by temperature. In contrast, the depth distribution of the shark relative to the vertical distribution of oxygen suggested that it was avoiding hypoxic conditions below 300meven though that is where the daytime peak of acoustic backscattering occurs in the Red Sea. Telemetry data also indicated crepuscular and daytime overlap of the shark's vertical habitat use with distinct scattering layers of small mesopelagic fishes and nighttime overlap with nearly all mesopelagic organisms in the Red Sea as these similarly undergo nightly ascents into epipelagic waters. We identify potential depths and diel periods in which pelagic thresher sharks may be most susceptible to fishery interactions, but more expansive research efforts are needed to informeffective management.

AB  - Length-weight relationships (LWRs) of three species of pelagic sharks belonging to the family Carcharhinidae viz., the silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis and the graceful shark C. amblyrhynchoides and Alopidae viz, the pelagic thresher Alopias pelagicus, were estimated based on 525 samples collected from the longline and gillnet fishery of southeastern Arabian Sea from January 2016 to November 2018. Two major fish landing centres of Kerala, southwest coast of India were selected for sampling; Cochin (Lat. 09 degrees 56'327 '' N, Long. 76 degrees 15'764 '' E) and Munambam (Lat. 10 degrees 10'965 '' N, Long. 76 degrees 10'258 '' E). The estimated allometric coefficient b value ranged from 2.687 (A. pelagicus, N = 122) to 3.11 (C. falciformis, N = 295). Coefficient of determination scores ranged from 0.901 (A. pelagicus) to 0.984 (C. amblyrhynchoides, N = 108), indicating robustness of the samples analysed. Maximum total length presented for C. amblyrhynchoides in this study was a new record. The study reports first estimates of length-weight relationships for three important species of pelagic sharks which contribute to most of the shark catches in the region, and the generated parameters will be useful for the assessment of stocks and sustainable management of pelagic sharks in southeastern Arabian Sea.

AB  - The damages of corn grain during threshing depend on many factors, the main of which is timely removal of grain from the threshing chamber what depends on the design of the deck. The functional parameters of the deck in self-propelled combines and stationary threshers used for threshing of seed corn have been studied. Studies of factors affecting the separation process of a mixture consisting of grain and other parts of corn cobs in the threshing chamber were carried out. It has been proved that the shape, size and layout of the deck holes have the greatest impact on the timeliness of the output of the threshed corn grain from the threshing chamber. In this case the deck should consist of three parts of different lengths: 1) a part of the deck of the chamber of the primary damage of the integrity of the cob grain structure; 2) the deck part of the main threshing chamber; 3) the deck part of the finish threshing chamber. The evaluation criteria for choosing the lengths of the deck parts are the average of the double ratio of the linear dimensions of the corn grain of the six main subspecies and the maximum length and diameter of the cobs of 65 main varieties cultivated in Russia. The ratio of the lengths of the first two sections of the deck should correspond to the Fibonacci golden section - 1.618 and the double ratio of the linear dimensions of all three sections - 1.29. The studies have evaluated the effect of the shape of the holes: round, round innate, square, rectangular, and hexagonal. At the same time, the pattern of holes on the hexagon and the square and the square holes, additionally, at an angle 45 degrees to the rotor axis was studied. The feasibility of using round holes in the deck with a diameter of at least 10...14 mm has been established. As a result of using the deck of the proposed design, the conditions for timely removal of threshed grain from the threshing chamber with a reduced probability of damage are created.

AB  - Background: Transcription factors are essential regulators of gene expression and play critical roles in development, differentiation, and in many cancers. To carry out their regulatory programs, they must cooperate in networks and bind simultaneously to sites in promoter or enhancer regions of genes. We hypothesize that the mRNA co-expression patterns of transcription factors can be used both to learn how they cooperate in networks and to distinguish between cancer types.
   Results: We recently developed a new algorithm, Thresher, that combines principal component analysis, outlier filtering, and von Mises-Fisher mixture models to cluster genes (in this case, transcription factors) based on expression, determining the optimal number of clusters in the process. We applied Thresher to the RNA-Seq expression data of 486 transcription factors from more than 10,000 samples of 33 kinds of cancer studied in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that 30 clusters of transcription factors from a 29-dimensional principal component space were able to distinguish between most cancer types, and could separate tumor samples from normal controls. Moreover, each cluster of transcription factors could be either (i) linked to a tissue-specific expression pattern or (ii) associated with a fundamental biological process such as cell cycle, angiogenesis, apoptosis, or cytoskeleton. Clusters of the second type were more likely also to be associated with embryonically lethal mouse phenotypes.
   Conclusions: Using our approach, we have shown that the mRNA expression patterns of transcription factors contain most of the information needed to distinguish different cancer types. The Thresher method is capable of discovering biologically interpretable clusters of genes. It can potentially be applied to other gene sets, such as signaling pathways, to decompose them into simpler, yet biologically meaningful, components.

AB  - Aim: Integrated use of organic and inorganic fertilizers has better effects on crop growth and yield components of crop as well as soil health than alone. The main objective of the study was to find out the impact of integrated nutrient management on yield and soil health in maize-wheat cropping system.
   Methodology: The maize crop was harvested when cob sheath turned brownish and grains became hard and grains were separated from cobs by hand shelling. When wheat crop matured and dry plants from net plot area were harvested and threshing was done by using wheat thresher and expressed as t ha'. The soil samples were collected from different plots of the experimental field and were analysed for physical (bulk density, hydraulic conductivity) and chemical (organic carbon, available N, P and K) properties. Infiltration rate was measured at the experimental field with the help of double ring infiltrometer.
   Results: Addition of NPK fertilizer along with organic manure and biofertilizers improved yield and increased organic carbon content, available N, P, K and infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity of the soil while reducing bulk density. Application of 50% recommended dose of fertilizer + 50% recommended dose of nitrogen produced significantly higher maize grain yield and significantly higher wheat grain yields were recorded with the application of 100% recommended dose of fertilizer over control. Lowest bulk density, highest hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate were recorded with the application of 37.5% recommended dose of fertilizer + 37.5% recommended dose of nitrogen + biofertilizer to wheat. Application of 50% recommended dose of fertilizer + 50% recommended dose of nitrogen to maize and application of 37.5% recommended dose of fertilizer + 37.5% recommended dose of nitrogen + bio fertilizer to wheat resulted in increased available N by 10.2, 19.6% and 15.5, 26.2%, available P by 13.7, 20.4% and 17.1, 33.2%, available K by 5.1, 7.6% and 6.4, 10.7% and organic carbon by 3.1, 7.3% and 4.3, 12.5% over control during 2011 and 2012, respectively.
   Interpretation: Grain yield, soil physical and chemical properties was found to be affected by the integrated nutrient management. It can be concluded that integrated use of crop residue mixed farmyard manure and inorganic sources of nutrients along with biofertilizers proved better nutrient management option for higher yield, soil health and net returns from maize-wheat cropping system.

AB  - The South African midwater trawl fishery targets adult horse mackerel Trachurus capensis. The bulk of the catch is taken by a single freezer-trawler, the biggest fishing vessel operating in South African waters. As fishing takes place off the south coast in ecologically sensitive areas, there are concerns about the potential impacts of this fishing operation on non-target species. Fishing behaviour and bycatch of this fishery from 2004 to 2014 were investigated by analysing observer records with regard to catch composition, volume and temporal and spatial patterns. The midwater trawl fishery was estimated to have caught 25 415 tonnes annually, with a bycatch of 6.9% of the total catch, by weight. There are species overlaps with various fisheries, namely the demersal trawl, small-pelagic, line, shark longline and squid fisheries, yet the total bycatch estimates from this fishery are generally small relative to catches taken in the target fisheries. Bycatch species with the highest average annual catches were chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, redeye roundherring Etrumeus whiteheadi, ribbonfish Lepidopus caudatus and hake Merluccius spp. Large-fauna bycatch species included sunfish Mola mola as well as a number of CITES II- and IUCN-listed species, such as Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena and thresher sharks Alopias spp. The 97.9% observer coverage is high and the 6.9% bycatch rate low compared to other South African fisheries; however, due to the large size of the individual hauls (average of 46.3 t), the average sampling rate of 1.56% is low. Our analyses suggest that bycatch in the South African midwater trawl fishery has been lower than in other South African fisheries and similar fisheries elsewhere, but due to the combination of high catch volumes and low sampling rates, estimation errors for rare species are high and there is a substantial risk of incidental unmonitored bycatch of rare large fauna and aggregations of small fauna. This could be mitigated by spatio-temporal management of this fishery, to avoid fishing in high-risk areas, and the introduction of an electronic monitoring programme.

AB  - Indonesia has the greatest reported chondrichthyan catches worldwide, with c.110,000t caught annually. The pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus) and scalloped hammerhead (Sphryna lewini) together comprise about 25% of the total catches of sharks landed in Indonesia. Age and growth parameters were estimated for A. pelagicus and S. lewini from growth-band counts of thin-cut vertebral sections. Alopias pelagicus (n = 158) and S. lewini (n = 157) vertebrae were collected from three Indonesian fish markets over a 5 year period. A multi-model analysis was used to estimate growth parameters for both species. The models of best fit for males and females for A. pelagicus was the three-parameter logistic (L = 3169mm L-T, k = 02) and the two-parameter von Bertalanffy models (L = 3281mm L-T, k = 012). Age at maturity was calculated to be 104 and 132years for males and females, respectively, and these are the oldest estimated for this species. The samples of S. lewini were heavily biased towards females, and the model of best fit for males and females was the three-parameter Gompertz (L = 2598mm L-T, k = 015) and the two-parameter Gompertz (L = 2896mm L-T, k= 016). Age at maturity was calculated to be 89 and 132years for males and females, respectively. Although numerous age and growth studies have previously been undertaken on S. lewini, few studies have been able to obtain adequate samples from all components of the population because adult females, adult males and juveniles often reside in different areas. For the first time, sex bias in this study was towards sexually mature females, which are commonly lacking in previous biological studies on S. lewini. Additionally, some of the oldest aged specimens and highest age at maturity for both species were observed in this study. Both species exhibit slow rates of growth and late age at maturity, highlighting the need for a re-assessment of the relative resilience of these two globally threatened sharks at current high levels of fishing mortality throughout the eastern Indian Ocean.

AB  - An enigmatic new tapeworm is described from pelagic thresher sharks in Mexico and Taiwan. While lsrRNA (D1-D3) data robustly place it in the Litobothriidea, it bears essentially no morphological resemblance to other members of the order. Instead it superficially resembles the freshwater fish-inhabiting Caryophyllidea. Its scolex consists of a simple dome-shaped scolex proper and an extensive cephalic peduncle housing four distinct tissue types. It is hyperapolytic, thus reproductive anatomy is unknown. Developmental data show typical litobothriideans bear basic elements of their adult scolex upon entering the definitive host, undermining the notion that the new cestode represents a distinct litobothriidean life cycle stage. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the new species shares bands of distinctive microtriches with its congeners. In combination these data justify establishment of Litobothrium aenigmaticum, sp. nov.; the generic, familial and ordinal diagnoses are emended accordingly. Unlike typical litobothriideans, each worm is associated with a mucosal expansion at its attachment site, like those seen in some caryophyllideans. This pathological change may represent a worm-induced host response serving to reinforce attachment of the simple scolex to the mucosa. If so, the convergence of this litobothriidean on a morphology like that seen in the distantly related Caryophyllidea is a result of similarity in mode of attachment.

AB  - Poppy can be grown in nearly every areas of Slovakia. Large-scale production technologies are used for cultivation. All agro-technical operations from sowing to harvest are fully mechanized. Crop stand is established by sowing 1-2 kg of treatment seeds per hectare. In order to obtain 1.2 t.ha(-1) yield, fertilization with basic nutrients is needed in following quantities: 50 kg N, 21.7 kg P2O5, 61.7 kg K2O a 66.7 kg CaO. B and Zn are important micronutrients. Growing of Slovakian poppy cultivars makes it possible to use herbicides against weeds. These cultivars are very tolerant. The herbicides do not have any phytotoxicity to poppy seedlings as compared with foreign cultivars. Pesticides against diseases and pests are also used. The harvest is realized using ordinary reaper-threshers. There are two ways of harvesting - the seed is either collected without the straw, which is immediately crushed and ploughed under, or with straw. This mixture can be stored for a short period and dried, if needed. Consequently, the mass is separated. To assure high quality of poppy straw for morphine extraction, an adapter is available which cuts the capsules with 100-150 mm long stem.

AB  - We used data collected by an observer program to assess the impact of the Costa Rican longline fishery on numbers, capture locations, seasonality and body sizes of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), pelagic thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus), olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) and other bycatch species in the Central American Pacific. The longline fishery caught a large number of mahi-mahi (Coryphaena sp.) and silky sharks, but also caught a large number of olive ridley turtles and pelagic stingrays (Pteroplatytrygon violacea). We estimated that longline fisheries caught 699,600 olive ridleys, including 92,300 adult females, from 1999 to 2010. These captures were associated with a decline of nesting populations at nearby arribada beaches. There were statistically significant size decreases from 1999 to 2010 in mature olive ridley turtles and from 2003 to 2010 in silky sharks. Average fork length of silky sharks in 2010 was 97.3 cm, which was far below observed fork length at maturity, 144 cm. Pelagic thresher sharks were small and fluctuated in size over the study period. Capture of large numbers of juvenile blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) indicated a nursery area near the Osa Peninsula. Geospatial analysis indicated shifts in mahi-mahi abundance on a temporal scale but fishing efforts did not shift with the shift in mahi-mahi abundance. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), Indo-Pacific blue marlin (Makaira mazara) and Indo-Pacific sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) catches varied seasonally and were most abundant out to sea and south of Panama. Marine protected areas and/or time area closures are needed to reduce the impact of the Costa Rican longline fishery on sea turtles and sharks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our objective is to carry out measurements and target the issues of electrothermic diagnostics. Electrothermic diagnostics may be carried out either using contact or non-contact type measuring systems. An example of non-contact type measuring system is the infrared spectrometry used for system analysis. Compared to contact-type measurement, infrared spectrometry has a number of advantages but, on the other hand, it also comes up against some considerable difficulties. When temperatures of the functional parts of mobile engines are analyzed, infrared spectrometry is accompanied by difficulties that make the method inapplicable. Contact-type measurement has the advantage of easy interpretation of the measured variable; its disadvantage is inapplicability to rotating engines or rotating parts of mobile equipment. This paper evaluates and compares individual methods used in electrothermic diagnostics. In particular, both, infrared spectrometry measurement carried out on a harvesting thresher and analysis of insulating materials samples for heat conduction by contact-type measurement, are examined. Advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods are investigated, and recommendations concerning application of the results on machines are provided. Our aim is to provide methodology guidance for application of the analyzed methods.

AB  - Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) is a warm season annual fiber crop. It has been traditionally used as cordage and in various new applications such as paper products, building materials, absorbents, and livestock feed. In Malaysia, kenaf has been viewed as a possible industrial crop of significance for large scale production. Being an annual crop, kenaf is grown from seed. A large quantity of seed supply is needed for continuous production. Currently seed availability is limited. Overseas seed companies generally produce seed on specified contracts. Under such circumstances, there is a need to produce kenaf seed locally for local consumption. A definite dry season of several months is needed to achieve good quantity and quality of kenaf seed. Kenaf grown under rainshelter has all the requirements for good seed production. However, harvesting kenaf seed is another major constraint as bristles from kenaf capsules can cause extreme itchiness and irritation to human skin. Padi combine harvester has been modified to harvest kenaf seed but its efficiency remains doubtful due to high seed loss in the field. Seed is usually mixed with a large quantity of green trash that affects seed quality. Currently, the R&D kenaf project is seeking small holders to produce seed. Designing a simple mechanical thresher will help to expedite seed threshing for the small holders to overcome skin irritation constraints.

AB  - Catch and effort data from a fishery-independent longline survey in the western North Atlantic were used to investigate the biology, distribution and abundance of pelagic sharks. Data were restricted to the period from 1977 to 1994, and for the months of June-August. Catches were dominated by the blue shark (Prionace glauca), with smaller numbers of shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), porbeagle (Lamna nasus), thresher (Alopias spp.) and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks. Detailed analysis was restricted to P. glauca due to small sample sizes for the other species. Male blue sharks were caught more often than females. The catches included juveniles and adults of both sexes but very few adult females. Annual sex ratios varied, but normally favored males. Monthly sex ratios were even in June, but favored males in July and August. Due to differences in occurrence between males and females, distribution and abundance data were analyzed separately for each sex. Male catch per unit effort (CPUE) was highest between 15 and 20 degreesC, while female CPUE peaked at approximately 15 degreesC and decreased with increasing water temperatures. CPUE for males and females were standardized using a generalized linear model with years, months and day-night as factors. Males showed an approximately 80% decline between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s, while a significant change in female catch rates could not be demonstrated. The results of the analyses are discussed in relation to fishery-dependent studies in the western North Atlantic, along with previous work on the biology and distribution of pelagic sharks.

AB  - Chickpea is one of the important protein and calorie rich food legume crops which may meet part of the nutrient needs of India. One of the ways to increase the availability of chick pea is to reduce threshing loss. Breakage of seeds occurs when a mechanical thresher with steel loops or raspbars or pegteeth beaters on cylinder are used. Force and energy required to detach the pedicel and break the pod under dynamic condition are taken as criteria in selecting the type of beater configuration to be used on cylinder based on minimum force and energy. Plastic (polyethylene) covered pegteeth and wire loops were selected and their performance was evaluated on two varieties of chickpea at three different levels of moisture content. A pendulum-type impactor was used to measure shear force and energy to detach pedicel and break pod in dynamic condition while an Instron Testing Machine was used to measure tensile force and energy to detach pedicel and compressive force and energy to break pod in quasi-static condition. Trends of force and energy show no definite advantage of one type pf beater over other type. Force and energy required in quasi-static conditions are several times greater than dynamic condition.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH

CP  - CONF ON SHARKS DOWN UNDER
AB  - Records of shark captures were extracted from the archives of 10 of the major New South Wales gamefishing clubs that operate from ports located between latitudes 33-degrees-S and 37-degrees-S. Although organized game fishing began off eastern Australia in 1936, the majority of catches were made after 1960. Data normally recorded by these clubs included common name of shark, whole weight, locality of capture, boat name and angler. Recognized single species of sharks recorded by these clubs were blue (Prionace glauca), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), white (Carcharodon carcharias), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and grey nurse (Carcharias taurus). Species identified only to generic level, and recorded by clubs, were whalers or requiem sharks (Carcharhinus spp.), hammerheads (Sphyrna spp.) and threshers (Alopias spp.). Analysis of catch records indicated that the mako shark was the most common species caught overall, although whaler sharks dominated the catch in the northern part of the study area and hammerhead sharks dominated the catch in the south. Grey nurse and white sharks were relatively rare in the southern part of the study area. Whaler sharks dominated the catch in the 1960s, and the proportions of blue and tiger sharks in the catch increased in the 1980s. Size ranges and distributions of some species also varied through time and by area. Some of the observed changes could be attributed to changed fishing practices, particularly the increasing popularity of tag-and-release and an increasing tendency to fish further from the coast. A marked decline in the number and proportion of white sharks in the catch since the 1970s gives cause for some concern regarding the status of that species off south-eastern Australia.

AB  - Though brown rice is rich in nutrition, one of the main reasons for non-adoption of brown rice is its higher cost. Looking into the importance of brown rice and foreseeing the increase in demand of brown rice, a need of a machinery fulfilling above purpose was felt, which can directly give output in the form of good quality brown rice at lower cost. Based on the review and physio-mechanical properties of four paddy varieties commonly grown in Haryana, the design concept of thresher for brown rice production was evolved, which consisted of co-axial split-rotor thresher that is especially suited for high moisture paddy; and two rotary dryers fitted with 18 nos. of ceramic infrared (IR) heaters (650 W) along the central axis of rotary dryer. Recently, IR radiation is being used for drying agricultural products for achieving fast and uniform heating of the grains for quick removal of moisture. A rubber sheller unit for brown rice production and conical abrasive polisher (as an optional feature) was added to produce white rice. Thus, a tractor operated paddy thresher-cum-dryercum- dehusker- cum-polisher was designed, developed and evaluated.

AB  - In view of the problem of plant entanglement threshing roller in the process of mechanized flax harvesting, a comb-brush air-suction composite flax capsule harvesting test stand was designed based on the harvesting method of harvesting capsules independently and then breaking the capsules to thresh them. The following four parameters were selected as experimental factors: the shape of comb tooth cross-section, the rotational speed of comb roller, the relative speed of machine travel and the air volume of centrifugal fan. The following four indicators were chosen as the experimental indicators: capsule removal rate, capsule breakage rate, capsule collection rate and plant winding rate. A four-factor and three-level orthogonal test was conducted. The results showed that the optimal combination of test factors was as follows: the shape of comb tooth cross-section was rectangular, the rotational speed of the brush roller was 90 rad/min, the speed of machine travel relative to the plant was 80 mm/s and the air volume of centrifugal fan was 6000 m3/h. Under the condition of better experiment parameters combination, the capsule removal rate was 96.45%, capsule shell breaking rate was 98.79%, capsule collection rate was 95.65% and flax plants winding rate was 2.52%. The comb-brush air -suction composite flax capsule harvesting test bench provided the feasibility scheme for the problem of plant winding thresher roller and capsule collection.

AB  - To quantify maternal provisioning of nutrients in the pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus) and the potential for negative impacts, the concentrations of trace elements (essential: Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Se, and Zn; nonessential: As, Ba, Cd, Hg, and Pb) and fractionation of stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) were analyzed in the muscle and liver of 10 pregnant females and 18 associated embryos. Essential trace elements were observed to be offloaded at higher concentrations to embryos, with the exception of Zn and Ni in liver, while nonessential trace elements were unevenly distributed between maternal-embryo tissues. Observed Hg concentrations were at levels considered toxic in A. pelagicus, but the Se: Hg molar ratios in all embryonic tissues were all greater than one. A negative correlation was observed between transfer ratios and concentrations of all elements in maternal tissue, indicating the existence of a regulatory mechanism in maternal ovaries of A. pelagicus. Compared with maternal specimens, associated embryos had higher delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in muscle and liver tissue. Negative correlations were observed between delta C-13, delta N-15, and Delta delta C-13 values and precaudal length in embryonic muscle tissue potentially reflecting either a dietary-habitat shift in pregnant females during the latter period of gestation or a physiological change modifying fractionation. Higher concentrations of essential elements are linked to potential benefits for embryos during early development, levels of Hg suggested a degree of anthropogenic impact with unknown consequences while the directionality of isotopic fractionation could suggest a potential reproductive migration as a protective mechanism for birthing.

AB  - To improve resistance to upcoming vulnerabilities to climate change and cope with rising food demand smallholders in Sub-Saharan Africa need to upgrade their local food systems. Upgrading strategies (UPS) within existing food value chains have the potential to secure food at the local to regional level. In this paper, we determined the roles of actors and their interlinkages and motivations in UPS, and identified possible success factors of group performance within different UPS in Tanzania: a) tied ridges, b) optimised market-oriented grain storage, c) maize sheller and d) millet thresher. We used individual interviews, via the social network analysis tool Net-Map, as well as focus group discussions. The results show that actors' motivations for participating in a UPS group differed between groups and between actors. Important success factors derived from these findings were favorable village locations followed by sociability and personal contact among stakeholders and with researchers. These results provide the basis for future strategic planning that will enhance participation and a potential up-scaling.

AB  - Sampling designs for collection of shark size composition data are needed to fill one of the primary knowledge gaps hampering management of shark fisheries in Central America. These designs need to be tailored towards multi species fisheries with highly structured landings, which are driven by buyer demand in port. In addition, due to the difficulty of maintaining catch quality outdoors in a tropical environment, the designs ideally would have minimal impact on the often-rapid catch landing process. In this study, simulations based on data from exhaustively sampled landings of Costa Rican mediana escala (78 landings) and avanzada (21 landings) commercial longline vessels were used to test single-cluster systematic sampling designs for estimating size (commercial weight category) composition of retained catches of shark species, as well as of other taxa present in landings with sharks. The wide range in numbers of sharks per landing led to sampling designs for which the frequency of within-landing sampling depended on the number of sharks to be landed. Designs for shark-only sampling and sampling of all taxa were tested. For the mediana escala fleet component, these designs performed well in terms of absolute relative error (ARE) for common species in the landings, including the silky shark, the dominant shark species, and swordfish, striped marlin and yellowfin tuna. There was less than a 5% chance that the ARE would exceed 0.2 for most weight categories of these species, even at the lowest sampling frequency. For all but the large weight category of striped marlin, there was only a 2% chance (or less) that the ARE would exceed 0.3. These results suggest that a single sampling design can be implemented for this fleet component to obtain estimates of the size composition of common shark and non-shark species, alike, in landings with sharks. For relatively uncommon shark species in the landings, such as hammerhead and the pelagic thresher sharks, the same sampling designs generally resulted in higher ARE, except for the dominant weight categories (small hammerhead sharks and large pelagic thresher sharks). However, the level of error itself associated with these designs may still be acceptable, depending on management needs; ARE can provide an overly pessimistic evaluation of performance for uncommon species. For landings of the avanzada fleet component, the performance of the shark-only sampling scenarios for the silky shark was generally similar to the results obtained for the mediana escala fleet component, except for the large weight category, although performance for this weight category, as measured by error, might still be acceptable. However, differences in performance between the shark-only and the all-fish scenarios for the silky shark raise the concern that the number of landings of avanzada vessels available for this analysis may be too small to make a definitive statement about sampling design performance for this fleet component.

AB  - Bean is among the most consumed and produced crops in Brazil. Given the high demand for food, the search for technologies and controllers to increase the efficiency of agricultural systems has grown. This study aimed to model artificial neural network (ANN) architectures to predict mechanical efficiencies in the semi-mechanized bean harvest. We used a multilayer perceptron network with three inputs (harvest moisture, threshing rotor rotation, and feed rate), two hidden layers of neurons, and one output (efficiency). We evaluated the efficiency in the header, separation on the threshing rotor, cleaning of sieves, and the total efficiency of the machine. ANN was processed by a scripted algorithm to model the network, alternate the number of neurons in hidden layers, as well as to select, test, and validate ANN with less error. ANN was validated by comparing its results with the experimental data. The architectures selected to predict efficiencies were 3-8-15-1 for the header, 3-9-7-1 for the thresher and separation, 3-5-11-1 for cleaning, and 3-15-10-1 for the total operation. ANN predicted satisfactory results with errors below 1% and a high hit rate, thus being valid to predict the efficiencies in the semi-mechanized bean harvest.

AB  - Sharks are fished for human consumption in Colombia, and fins are exported illegally to international markets. The goal was to identify differences in total mercury (THg) concentrations in fins and muscles of shark species seized in the Buenaventura port (Colombian Pacific), and to assess potential human health risks related to shark consumption. Seven species were considered in this study: Pelagic Thresher (Alopias pelagicus), Pacific Smalltail Shark (Carcharhinus cerdale), Brown Smoothhound (Mustelus henlei), Sicklefin Smoothhound (Mustelus lunulatus), Scalloped Bonnethead (Sphyrna corona), Scalloped Hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), and Bonnethead Shark (Sphyrna tiburo), and THg was analyzed in shark tissues. 24% muscle samples concentrations were above international recommended limits for human consumption, especially for A. pelagicus and S. lewini. Stable isotopes (delta 13C and delta 15N) analysis showed a foraging overlapping in coastal habitats, where overfishing usually occurs. This study provides useful scientific information to develop management plans for sharks in Colombia and neighboring countries.

AB  - The article describes the basic agrotechnical requirements for soybean combine harvesting. The current model range of adapters and headers used by agricultural producers for harvesting is analyzed. The design features and purpose of the headers and adapters to be used are studied. The results of experimental studies using dedicated soybean harvesting headers manufactured by Rostselmash in the real economic conditions of the Southern Federal District of the Russian Federation and a theoretical calculation of the optimal length of the header table are presented. Studies of combine harvesters from Rostselmash (Nova 340, Vector, TORUM) having various designs of threshers (single-drum; axial-flow) have shown that RSM-181 TORUM 750+ZhSU-900 and RSM-181 TORUM 740+ZhSU-700 combine harvesters have high productivity per hour of the main period equal to 5.20 and 4.80 ha / h respectively. This can be explained by the presence of a large working width header, a high speed of movement and an axial-flow thresher used on the combine. When harvesting long-stalked soybeans, the length of the header table is of great importance, which determines the reliability of the header auger, the uniformity of the plant mass supply to the combine thresher. As a result of theoretical calculations, it was established that the header table length should be L_ht >= 0.81 m. Manufacturers of current headers recommend replacing a serial length table with a table having an extended length when harvesting long-stalked soybeans.

AB  - The design validation of thresher mechanism is done with artificial neural network (ANN). The supervised and unsupervised learning models are developed through design test data and experimental test results. The ANN model is developed and trained using back propagation algorithm with seven epoches and data set of 700 test trail results. The trained model gives minimum RSME 0.0057. The model obtained is compared through correlation analysis and average correlation coefficient 0.9623. The parametric design model obtained from ANN is implied through Arduino sketch developed for real-time controlling of thresher parameters in machine. The designed sketch with an interfacing of IR speed sensor is used to address the crop configuration as a function of crop strength. The real-time monitoring of crop configuration is noted and processed for controlling thresher encoder motor speed. The designed ANN model prevents application of single failure model and real-time controlling of threshing parameter commit highest efficiency.

AB  - This paper examines whether the adoption of the ASI thresher technology by rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley increases their access to credit and their creditworthiness through various pathways. Mainly, this study seeks to verify the argument that the adoption of technologies that increase factor productivity and production capacity eventually leads to the ability (and desire) of adopters to borrow more due to enhanced operations and confidence in their ability to repay loans. This paper uses primary data collected from 194 adopters and nonadopters of the ASI thresher in the Senegal River Valley. Four propensity score matching techniques (nearest neighbour, calliper, stratification and kernel) were used to analyze the data and to remove the selection bias due to observable characteristics. The results from the four techniques consistently show that ASI rice thresher adopters borrowed more money (between 194,000 and 432,000 CFA) in comparison to their neighbours who had not adopted the ASI thresher. This study recommends that, in order to move rice system development closer to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, policymakers and other stakeholders should increase their proactive efforts to promote ASI adoption in Senegal and other rice-producing regions in Africa. The originality of this paper and its contribution to the literature mainly lie in the quantification of the credit farmers gained and the increase in their creditworthiness due to the adoption of a technology.

AB  - Engineering properties of grains and agricultural commodities are significant for process and equipment design which is affected by moisture content. Three different varieties of pigmented wheat grain at different moisture content ranges from 12 to 18% (db) were undertaken for the detailed investigation. Grain length, width, thickness, sphericity, volume, surface area, porosity, and angle of repose increased from 6.3 to 7.6 mm, 2.4 to 3.3 mm, 2.1 to 2.9 mm, 0.50 to 0.56, 18.3 to 40.4 mm(3), 28.3 to 48.0 mm(2), 38.6 to 43.8%, and 22.0 to 27.0 degrees with an increase in moisture, respectively. The coefficient of friction was increased throughout the range and maximum friction was found on a wood surface for black, and rubber sheet for blue and purple wheat and the minimum friction was observed in glass sheet for black and purple and aluminum for blue wheat. However, bulk density, true density, and hardness was reduced from 750.6 to 673.6 kg/m(3), 1,226.2 to 1,192.0 kg/m(3), and 166.2 to 66.0 kg, respectively. Lightness (L), a value (red-green axis), b value (yellow-blue axis), hue angle, and chroma value decreased from 40.7 to 29.2, 6.6 to 1.5, 9.8 to 6.0, 80.2 to 54.4, and 70.3 to 35.6 respectively, with an increase in moisture (12 to 18%, db).
   Practical applications Determining the engineering characteristics of cereal is imperative to upgrade the design parameters of agricultural equipment used in their production, handling, and storage processes such as sorting, isolating, and cleaning, also to decide the optimization of grain metering gadget in pneumatic grower and precision planting machine to suit each estimate of these grains. The shape of the grains is a significant criterion that impacts passing on the attribute of solid materials via air or water. The thickness and porosity of the wheat grain help measure the containers and capacity holders. Frictional properties like the static coefficient of friction and angle of repose are helped in designing the storage containers, chutes, containers, screw conveyers, threshers, and forage harvesters. Natural and hereditary aspect is liable for the variation in engineering properties of wheat grain varieties.

AB  - Species-specific bans are increasingly being implemented to stem loss of vulnerable marine species, but there is a paucity of evaluative research into resulting socioeconomic and ecological consequences. In 2012, a blanket ban on landing Alopiidae (thresher) sharks was introduced in Sri Lanka. We used fisher perceptions, shown to influence support and compliance with conservation policies, to examine human responses. Data, gathered over a ten-month period in 2019 from focus groups and informal engagement during site visits, suggest support for the ban was lowest amongst fishers who perceived negative social consequences to be higher. Perceptions were also undermined by feelings of poor engagement from institutions and a lack of ecological necessity. The ban appears effective in halting targeted fisheries; however, persistent bycatch was reported by fishers. Further, bycatch appears to be widely unrecorded partly owing to mistrust and confusion amongst fishers. Occasional illegal landings were reported, seemingly motivated by interlinked factors such as good economic returns for thresher meat and high vessel running costs. The potential severity and inequity in social consequences stemming from blanket bans was highlighted, particularly when bycatch and targeted fisheries co-exist. Case study lessons are translated into a checklist containing key questions, designed to aid policy-makers to assess data provision and needs prior to introducing bans. Increasing data provision could enhance the capability of policies to predict and adapt to human behavioural responses, a key requirement considering continuing global declines in sharks despite increasing conservation effort.

AB  - The diet and feeding habits of the pelagic thresher sharkAlopias pelagicuswere analysed based on 104 stomachs (N = 84 females, 20 males) collected off Santa Rosa de Salinas, in the Ecuadorian Pacific. The sharks were caught between February 2008 and January 2009 in artisanal fisheries. The trophic spectrum ofA. pelagicusincluded 19 prey items (10 cephalopods and 9 teleost fishes), the main four prey were the red flying squidOmmastrephes bartramii, jumbo squidDosidicus gigas, the purpleback flying squidSthenoteuthis oualaniensisand the South Pacific hakeMerluccius gayi.The trophic niche was narrow (B-i= 0.2), thus the pelagic thresher could be considered a specialist predator. The analysis of dietary overlap showed high similarity between the diets of females and males (C-lambda= 0.99), immature and mature females (C-lambda= 0.81), immature and mature males (C-lambda= 0.72), sizes of 141-230 cm TL and 231-321 cm TL (C-lambda= 0.97), as well as sharks in rainy season and dry season (C-lambda= 0.77). Using canonical of correspondence analysis (CCA), we found similarities in the diet for all categories recorded (sex:canonical r= 0.38,P= 0.97; sexual maturity stage:canonical r= 0.54,P= 0.31; sizes:canonical r= 0.55,P= 0.26; seasons of the year:canonical r= 0.61,P= 0.75). The trophic level estimated forA. pelagicuswas 5.0, which is typical of top predators (quaternary consumers or tertiary carnivores).

AB  - The threshing gap of the thresher device for rice combine harvester has to be adjusted in real time based on different feed rates to ensure the operation efficiency in the harvesting process. However, adjusting the threshing gap by changing the position of concave grid may result in unevenness of threshing gap of the thresher device and further impact on the fluidity of material in the thresher device; in addition, it is also unavailable to adjust the threshing gap by changing the drum diameter when the rice combine harvester is in operation. In view of the above and based on axial flow threshing drum, the design of a variable-diameter threshing drum available for overall and rapid drum diameter adjustment and the research on diameter adjustment device as well as electronic control self-locking device were introduced in this study. Besides, stress analysis was implemented to the diameter adjustment device to ensure the stability of the variable-diameter threshing drum. Field experiment was implemented to identify the difference between the impacts brought to the threshing performance (grain-entrainment loss rate, damage rate, threshing efficiency, and threshing power consumption) by both methods for threshing gap adjustment. The experiment result shows that the drum adjustment method with variable-diameter drum features higher grain-entrainment loss rate, threshing efficiency, and threshing power consumption, yet stable in terms of consumption fluctuation, but a lower damage rate than their counterparts with concave adjustment method.

TI  - Optimization of Parameters of Axial Flow Paddy Thresher
T2  - AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA

AB  - An axial flow thresher was modified to maintain the seed quality in terms of broken grains. The machine got fabricated from local market and its performance was studied on paddy PR-118 to ascertain the effect of louver angles, peripheral speed and feed rate on threshing efficiency, cleaning efficiency, broken grains, grain output, rate of crop flow, non-collectable loss and power requirement. The louver angles, peripheral speed and feed rate had a significant effect on grain damage during the paddy threshing. The broken grains varied from 0.11 to 2.48%. The broken grains were decreased with increase in louver angles from 10 degrees to 15 degrees but further increase in louver angles from 15 degrees to 20 degrees, the broken grain was increased. The similar trend was obtained for threshing efficiency. The rate of crop flow increased with increase in louver angle. Grain output was found to be in the range of 319 to 555 kg/h for the feed rate of 1.5 to 2.5 t/h. The power requirement decreased with increase in louver angles. Similarly non collectable loss decreased with increase in louver angles. The optimum values for broken grains, threshing efficiency, cleaning efficiency, Retention time, power requirement, grain output, rate of crop flow and non-collectable loss was 0.11%, 98.6%, 97.27%, 5.09 seconds, 12.86 kW, 543.13 kg/ h, 5.24 q/h and 0.01% respectively. (q (quintal) = 100 kg).

AB  - The Mediterranean Large Elasmobranchs Monitoring (MEDLEM) database contains more than 3,000 records (with more than 4,000 individuals) of large elasmobranch species from 21 different countries around the Mediterranean and Black seas, observed from 1666 to 2017. The principal species included in the archive are the devil ray (1,868 individuals), the basking shark (935 individuals), the blue shark (622 individuals), and the great white shark (342 individuals).
   In the last decades, other species such as the thresher shark (187 individuals), the shortfin mako (180 individuals), and the spiny butterfly ray (138) were reported with increasing frequency. This was possibly due to increased public awareness on the conservation status of sharks, and the consequent development of new monitoring programs. MEDLEM does not have homo-geneous reporting coverage throughout the Mediterranean and Black seas and it should be considered as a database of observed species presence. Scientific monitoring efforts in the south-eastern Mediterranean and Black seas arc generally lower than in the northern sectors and the absence of some species in our database does not imply their actual absence in these regions. However, the available data allowed us to analyse the frequency and spatial distribution of records, the size frequencies for a few selected the available data allowed us to analyse the frequency and spatial distribution of records, the size frequencies for a few selected species, the overall area coverage, and which species are involved as bycatch by different fishing gears.

CP  - 8th Annual International Scientific and Practical Conference on Innovative Technologies in Science and Education (ITSE)
AB  - The paper is dedicated to the innovative analytical research in the field of pneumatic separation concerning the issues of grain heap feed for harvester-thresher cleaning, composition of tailings and the amount of grain. The problem of improving the separation of air-sieve cleaning of modern combines is of great current interest. The cleaning design with the use of pneumatic and inertia separator of small grain heaps for high-producing harvester-thresher is developed. The engineering study is conducted for the installation of the 8-bladed rotor above the chaffer sieve for experimental cleaning taking into account dimensional limitations and minimal alteration of the current air-sieve cleaning. The results of the study show the opportunity of better operation of the design of small grain heap cleaning with the application of pneumatic and inertia separator. The developed solutions make it possible to reduce grain losses and increase the harvester-thresher productivity level, as a result of which it is expected to achieve the economic effect assessed in the study.

AB  - Ajwain seeds are used as spice and have high medicinal values. The ajwain seed varieties selected were set at 8, 12, 16, and 20% moisture content on dry basis (db) for this study. The geometrical dimensions showed linear increment with the increase in moisture content of ajwain seeds. The true density and porosity increased from 1,069 to 1,697kgm(-3) and 15.84-42.88%, respectively, across the three varieties of ajwain seeds with the increasing moisture content. The bulk density showed a decreasing trend of 1049.81-857.14kgm(-3) with the increasing moisture content. The coefficient of friction was also found to increase for all the varieties, but the maximum friction was found for the cardboard surface and the minimum friction was observed in case of aluminium sheet. The thermal diffusivity of seeds decreased from 4.09 to 2.46m(2) s(-1) with the increasing moisture content. Thermal conductivity and specific heat showed a marked increase with increasing moisture content. Varietal differences among the ajwain seeds of variety AA-1, AA-2, and AA-93 were also studied at 5% significance level. Significant differences were observed between the three ajwain varieties, namely AA-1, AA-2, and AA-93 in context to their physical and thermal properties.
   Practical applicationsThe physical and thermal properties of ajwain seeds will be useful in designing of processes and equipment required for its processing. These properties give detailed information about the quality of the seeds, its acceptability to consumers and the behavior of the ajwain post production, during storage and consumption and post consumption. The knowledge on physical properties such as seed size, shape, volume, surface area, mass, density, porosity helps in designing the separating, storing, handling, and drying systems. The grading and sizing machineries will be based on the size and shape of the ajwian seeds. The density and porosity of the ajwain seeds will help in sizing the hoppers and storage containers. The density of seeds will also play role in separation based on density or specific gravities. The frictional properties like coefficient of friction and angle of repose will help in designing the storage bins, chutes, hoppers, screw conveyers, threshers, and forage harvesters. Thermal properties of ajwain seeds will be useful in analyzing and designing of equipment involving heat transfer, such as in case of cooking, sterilizing and drying.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment (ERA), including Productivity-Susceptibility Analysis (PSA), is becoming increasingly used to assess the relative vulnerability of data-limited non-target species to the impacts by fishing. PSA was developed for the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) tuna purse-seine fishery to assess the vulnerability of incidentally-caught species for three set types, "dolphin sets", "unassociated sets" and "floating-object sets", during 2005-2013. Because of operational differences between these set types, susceptibility values were combined for each species across the three set types to produce an overall fleet-wide susceptibility estimate. Vulnerability was highest for elasmobranchs, namely the giant manta ray, bigeye and pelagic thresher sharks, smooth and scalloped hammerhead sharks, and silky shark. Billfishes, dolphins, other rays, ocean sunfish, and yellowfin and bigeye tunas were classified as moderately vulnerable while the remaining species, all teleosts, had the lowest vulnerability scores. This purse-seine fleet-wide PSA identified potentially vulnerable species that can be compared with PSAs for other fisheries operating in the EPO, once detailed catch information becomes available for those fisheries. Such information can assist managers with prioritising fishery- and species-specific research programs and/or mitigation measures.

AB  - The stomach contents of thresher sharks (Alopias spp.; 162-385 cm total length) were collected from five landing points in northern Peru during 2015. A total of 128 thresher sharks were sampled, with 38 individuals identified as Alopias pelagicus and 90 aggregated to the genus level Alopias sp. to prevent any misidentification. The diet comprised 13 and 10 prey taxa for Alopias sp. and A. pelagicus, respectively. Humboldt squid Dosidicus gigas dominated the diet of both groups, with only minor differences in the diet in relation to size classes and location. The diet of Alopias shows a high degree of specialization and the average trophic positions were high for both groups, A. pelagicus (4.4 +/- 0.13) and Alopias sp. (4.5 +/- 0.14).

AB  - This paper suggests a modified thresher machine design for minimizing the problem of choking in the concave. As surveyed in the district of Dantaramgarh, Rajasthan, the major hitch faced by the farmers in employing multi-crop thresher machine is the choking of straw and chaff in concave clearance as the speed of feed is increased. As the feed is increased, the chaff aggregate increases considerably and is forced down the clearance and chokes it subsequently. To resolve the issue, a design was suggested that entailed a concave frame to hold the concave instead of being an integral part of mainframe of machine. The mechanism introduced to move the concave frame was termed as anti-choking mechanism.

Solving the problem of harvesting broom corn (Sorghum vulgare var. technician) with minimal expenditure of labor and resources, and high quality is possible through improving existing or developing new processes and equipment for harvesting. At the same time, the proposed new processes and equipment should ensure the reduction or complete elimination of the share of manual labor. The purpose of the work is to improve the process for harvesting of broom corn based on a complex performance criterion.
   Materials and Methods. The methodological basis for choosing an effective process for harvesting broom corn was the theory of efficiency of technical systems. According to it, the latter is estimated using the value of a complex criterion that includes a set of particular indicators and their relative importance.
   Results. It is proposed to evaluate the efficiency of the broom corn harvesting process according to a complex criterion that takes into account particular indicators and their relative importance. A developed process for harvesting broom corn includes: threshing of standing broom corn in the direct flow offset threshing chamber of a combine harvester with simultaneous mowing of the threshed plants using the combine harvester thresher; collecting the threshed and mown plants in the tractor trailer and the threshed grain in the hopper; transportation of threshed and cut plants to the place of storage; and stacking of threshed plants with drying them using active ventilation. Based on experimental studies, the values of all the studied particular indicators and their coefficients of relative importance were determined; a comprehensive performance criterion for the existing process for broom corn harvesting and the proposed process was calculated.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The calculated values of coefficients K-1* and K-2* for the existing and proposed processes for harvesting broom corn were used to determine the complex performance criterion, which is phi(W-i) = 15.54 for the existing process and phi(W-i) = 2588.75 for the proposed one respectively. According to the complex criterion, the proposed harvesting process is more efficient than that currently used more than 160 times.

AB  - Peru is one of the world's leading fishing nations and its seafood industry relies on the trade of a vast variety of aquatic resources, playing a key role in the country's socio-economic development. DNA barcoding has become of paramount importance for systematics, conservation, and seafood traceability, complementing or even surpassing conventional identification methods when target organisms show similar morphology during the early life stages, have recently diverged, or have undergone processing. Aiming to increase our knowledge of the species diversity available across the Peruvian supply chain (from fish landing sites to markets and restaurants), we applied full and mini-barcoding approaches targeting three mitochondrial genes (COI, 16S, and 12S) and the control region to identify samples purchased at retailers from six departments along the north-central Peruvian coast. DNA barcodes from 131 samples were assigned to 55 species (plus five genus-level taxa) comprising 47 families, 24 orders, and six classes including Actinopterygii (45.03%), Chondrichthyes (36.64%), Bivalvia (6.87%), Cephalopoda (6.11%), Malacostraca (3.82%), and Gastropoda (1.53%). The identified samples included commercially important pelagic (anchovy, bonito, dolphinfish) and demersal (hake, smooth-hound, Peruvian rock seabass, croaker) fish species. Our results unveiled the marketing of protected and threatened species such as whale shark, Atlantic white marlin, smooth hammerhead (some specimens collected during closed season), shortfin mako, and pelagic thresher sharks. A total of 35 samples (26.72%) were mislabeled, including tilapia labeled as wild marine fish, dolphinfish and hake labeled as grouper, and different shark species sold as "smooth-hounds". The present study highlights the necessity of implementing traceability and monitoring programs along the entire seafood supply chain using molecular tools to enhance sustainability efforts and ensure consumer choice.

AB  - Madagascar is a major rice-producing country in Africa and its production is mainly from Central Highland. Area around Lake Alaotra in the north-east of the highland occupies about 40% of production, where relatively large-scale (ca. 3 ha) farmers operate Chinese two-wheel tractors for tillage and transportation. In other areas, tillage is done with traditional methods such as angady (shovel) or oxen-drawn plow. Hand weeders, sickles and threshing drums are commonly used. Traditional blacksmiths in Itasy region continue supplying reliable tools, and various artisan fabricating small implements are found almost everywhere. Rice milling has been done with Engel-berg machines, but they are now being replaced by Chinese husker-polishers and yield better quality of grains than before. Retail shops handle motorized machines and supply spare parts, but in most cases maintenance workshops are separately operated. The two-wheel tractors need annual heavy maintenance and have a short machine life, and therefore, more durable and reliable tractors are requested. There is a room for introducing machines other than two-wheel tractors such as reapers near Lake Alaotra. In other areas, simple farm implements made by local artisans such as pedal threshers are partly disseminated as a step of mechanization, but currently the possibility is low for introducing motorized machines.

AB  - In manual pulse thresher, input rotary motion is converted into reciprocating motion of beaters. Due to indefinite swing angle of beaters usual four bar linkage cannot be used for this purpose. In this proposed investigation, a novel mechanism has been designed to overcome the problem of indefinite swing angle as is necessary for meaningful operation of manual pulse thresher. Here, Grash of mechanism has been modified to generate the desired kinematics. At first, particular four bar linkage satisfying Grash of's criteria has been designed considering definite swing angle of beaters, followed by a suitably designed slot has been incorporated into the coupler design to obtain indefinite swing angle. This modified linkage mechanism has been tested successfully to generate variable (may vary even on every cycle) swinging of beaters while taking rotary motion as input.

AB  - Litobothrium aenigmaticum Caira, Jensen, Waeschenbach, & Littlewood 2014 is a cestode species that parasitizes pelagic thresher sharks in Taiwan and the Gulf of California. A previous study using light microscopy suggested the scolex contains four types of unusual tissues, one of which was considered to aid in adhesion of the worm to the mucosa of the spiral intestine. The function of the other tissues was unknown. Also unknown was the function of two laterally paired ducts found extending throughout the length of the worm. The goal of the present study was to use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the internal anatomy of the scolex and cephalic peduncle of this tapeworm in more detail. Three specimens from Taiwan were examined with TEM and two with light microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the laterally paired ducts were excretory, since they were closely associated with numerous protonephridia. The number of cell types, previously referred to as tissues, in the scolex was expanded to 11 based on a combination of features including cell size, nucleus size, ratio of the maximum diameter of the nucleus to maximum diameter of the whole cell, and types of observed organelles, as well as the presence or absence of cytoplasmic electron-dense and electron-lucent vesicles. The cytoplasm of all 11 cell types was found to include electron-dense vesicles, and all types were periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive. This suggests that the electron-dense vesicles may contain glycoproteins and/or mucoproteins. As all 11 cell types occurred within the region of the scolex that is surrounded by a papilla of host mucosa at the site of tapeworm attachment, we hypothesize that one or more of these cell types may produce a substance that induces this inflammatory reaction. The specific products in the secretory vesicles and how those products are released are still unclear, as are any relationships between or among the cell types in terms of products produced. Further research will be necessary to fully understand the complexity of this organism.

AB  - The family Sphyriocephalidae Pintner, 1913, which comprises the genera Hepatoxylon Bosc, 1811, Sphyriocephalus Pintner, 1913 and Heterosphyriocephalus Palm, 2004, is revised from newly-collected and museum material. Heterosphyriocephalus encarnae n. sp. is described from the pelagic thresher, Alopias pelagicus Nakamura (Lamniformes: Alopiidae) collected from the Pacific Ocean off Boca del Alamo, Mexico. This species can be readily distinguished from the rest of sphyriocephalids by its small size, low number of proglottids and long velum with a characteristically irregular and folded border, among other features. The tentacles show a distinctive basal armature, and a heteroacanthous typical metabasal armature with heteromorphous hooks. Rede-scriptions are provided for Sphyriocephalus tergestinus Pintner, 1913 and S. viridis (Wagener, 1854) Pintner 1913 based on novel morphological data. A phylogenetic analysis including the available sequences of sphyriocephalid species plus new generated sequences of S. tergestinus has been performed, from which S. tergestinus is allocated into Heterosphyriocephalus as H. tergestinus n. comb. New dichotomous keys for the determination of genera of Sphyriocephalidae are provided, as well as new generic diagnoses for Sphyriocephalus and Heterosphyriocephalus and keys for the determination of species within both genera. Although the morphology of the genus Hepatoxylon is not addressed in the present study, the available sequence of the type-species has been incorporated in the phylogenetic analysis and its relationship to the other two genera of the family is discussed.

AB  - Presently, due to an increase in usage of large scale mechanical threshers and combine harvesters, moisture content of freshly harvested paddy is being high as much as 18-24%. The mechanical threshers or combine harvesters with elevated capacity enable for both harvesting and threshing at once. Thus the paddy harvested all over persists with high moisture content that affects adversely in unit operations of paddy processing such as cleaning, storing, and milling. The research was conducted to overcome this problem by developing a mobile paddy dryer that can be used at field level for freshly harvested paddy. A mobile dryer, one ton capacity, was developed and tested for drying freshly harvested paddy. The performance of the mobile dryer was evaluated in terms of overall thermal efficiency, heat utilization factor, coefficient of performance, total heat efficiency and head rice yields. The overall thermal efficiency of this dryer was 46.83%. The average heating efficiencies namely heat utilization factor and total heat efficiency were 0.82 and 0.72 respectively. The coefficient of performance of the developed dryer was 0.18. The head rice yields of freshly harvested paddy after drying at 60 degrees C air temperature was of 73.78%. The overall drying performance of the dryer was found to be good. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Motivation: This article presents Thresher, an improved technique for finding peak height thresholds for automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) profiles. We argue that thresholds must be sample dependent, taking community richness into account. In most previous fragment analyses, a common threshold is applied to all samples simultaneously, ignoring richness variations among samples and thereby compromising cross-sample comparison. Our technique solves this problem, and at the same time provides a robust method for outlier rejection, selecting for removal any replicate pairs that are not valid replicates.
   Results: Thresholds are calculated individually for each replicate in a pair, and separately for each sample. The thresholds are selected to be the ones that minimize the dissimilarity between the replicates after thresholding. If a choice of threshold results in the two replicates in a pair failing a quantitative test of similarity, either that threshold or that sample must be rejected. We compare thresholded ARISA results with sequencing results, and demonstrate that the Thresher algorithm out-performs conventional thresholding techniques

AB  - The reproductive biology of the pelagic thresher shark Alopias pelagicus, was analysed based on 241 individuals (101 males and 140 females). Samples were collected from April 2005 to February 2006, from the artisanal fishery in Manta, Ecuador. Males ranged from 68 to 183 cm precaudal length (PL); females ranged from 70 to 180 cm PL. In embryos, sexual proportion was 1F:1M; while in adults the proportion was 1.4F:1M, which suggests sexual segregation in maturing individuals. We showed differences in the development of reproductive structures according to the reproductive condition, and in males the size at maturity occurs at 144.3 cm PL and in females at 151.4 cm PL. We recorded 33 pregnant females that presented one embryo in each uterus in different developmental stages. The results of this study provide information on reproduction of the species that will help to establish an appropriate fisheries management.

AB  - Economic growth in Indian agricultural sector lags behind growth in industry and services, creating an ever widening rural-urban income gap. Agricultural mechanization plays a key role in improving agricultural production and productivity in developing countries. The average farm size in India is small (1.16 ha) and small and marginal land holdings (less than 2.0 ha) account for 85% of land holdings. Mechanizing small and non-contiguous group of small farms is against 'economies of scale' for individual ownership of farm machinery. The status of farm mechanization in India is analysed by the trend in growth of mechanically power-operated farm equipment over traditional human and animal power operated equipment. It was observed that there was a direct correlation between farm power availability and productivity during the past six decades. Haryana state of India has the highest tractor density per thousand hectare of net seeded area of 84 tractors and followed by 76 tractors for Punjab against all India average of 33 tractors. The sale of transplanter, power weeder, combine harvesters, rotavator and thresher in India is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50, 50, 28, 20 and 10 %, respectively. The available farm power and productivity in India are expected to reach 2.2 kW/ha and 2.3 t/ha, respectively by the year 2020.
   The widely fragmented and scattered land holdings in many parts of the country need to be consolidated to reap benefits of agricultural mechanization. There is a need to innovate custom service or a rental model by institutionalization for high cost farm machinery such as combine harvester, sugarcane harvester, potato combine, paddy transplanter, laser guided land leveller, rotavator etc. to reduce the cost of operation and can be adopted by private players or State or Central Organizations in major production hubs. The farm machinery bank may be established for machines being manufactured elsewhere in the country to supply in low mechanised region on custom hiring basis. Financial assistance or procurement subsidy may be provided for the purchase of agriculture machinery and equipment on individual ownership or custom hiring basis.

AB  - Information on the ecology and feeding behaviour of the large oceanic predatory fishes is crucial for the ecosystem approaches to fisheries management models. Co-existing large pelagic predators in the open oceans may avoid competition for the limited forage by resource partitioning on spatial, temporal or trophic levels. To test this, we studied the prey species composition, diet overlap, trophic level, and trophic organisation of 12 large predatory fishes co-existing in the eastern Arabian Sea. Stomach contents of 1,518 specimens caught by exploratory longline operations in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone during the years 2006-2009 were analysed. Finfishes were dominant prey of all species except blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), which fed mainly on cephalopods, and long-snouted lancetfish (Alepisaurus ferox) and pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea), which fed mainly on crustaceans. Common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) and yellowfin tuna fed on a wider variety of prey than the other species, while the diets of lancetfish and black marlin (Istiompax indica) were narrowest. Pelagic stingray and great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) fed on species occupying epipelagic waters, whereas the contribution of mesopelagic prey was higher in the diets of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus). Trophic levels of these fishes ranged from 4.13 to 4.37. Diet overlap index revealed that some of the large pelagic predatory fishes share common prey species. Cluster analysis of the diets revealed four distinct trophic guilds namely 'flyingfish feeders' (common dolphinfish and great barracuda); 'mesopelagic predators' (pelagic thresher and swordfish); 'crab feeders' (lancetfish, pelagic stingray and silky shark) and 'squid feeders' (yellowfin tuna, Indo-Pacific sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), black marlin and blue marlin). Large predatory fishes of the eastern Arabian Sea target different prey types, and limit their vertical extent and time of feeding to avoid competing for prey.

AB  - Handling losses during threshing and mechanical conveying of Jatropha are affected by the size, shape and engineering properties of Jatropha seed. These parameters were studied for 5 varieties of Jatropha Shu 03001, Shu 03002, Shu 03004, Shu 03005 and Shu 04004. Physical measurements of the size along three perpendicular axes were made. The average size of the Jatropha seed varied according to variety. The average length was maximum for Shu 03005 and the average width and average thickness was maximum for Shu 03001. Overall dimensions were minimum for Shu 03004 and maximum for Shu 03001. Equivalent diameter was minimum for Shu 03002 and maximum for Shu 03001. Specific surface area was minimum for Shu 03001 and maximum for Shu 03004. Sphericity was minimum for Shu 03004 and maximum for Shu 03001. Average value of angle of repose for Jatropha was 33.824 degrees. The test weight was maximum for Shu 03005 and was minimum for Shu 04004. The average value of bulk density of Jatropha seed was minimum for Shu 03001 and was maximum for Shu 03004. True density was minimum for Shu 03001 and maximum for Shu 04004. Porosity was minimum for Shu 03004 and maximum for Shu 04004. Angle of internal friction with wooden and smooth mild steel surface was maximum for Shu 03001 and for corroded mild steel surface it was maximum for Shu 03005. Weight of a single seed was maximum for Shu 03005 and minimum for Shu 03001. A reverse trend was observed for hardness. It was concluded that the cylinder concave clearance for design of a thresher depended on the overall dimension of seed. This clearance should not be less than 13.489 mm for a Jatropha thresher. Impact force should be less than 6.026 kg for threshing without damage of Jatropha seed with the thresher. These results provided the necessary information for designers of equipment for handling, sorting, grading and threshing machinery of Jatropha seed. From this study it was recommended that the minimum cylinder-concave clearance should be 13.489 mm to avoid breakage of seed during threshing and the impact force should be less than 6.026 kg for threshing of Jatropha without damage.

AB  - Threshing is an essential pretreatment in rice yield-related traits evaluation and rice thresher is an important study of agricultural machinery automation. However, traditional threshers aim at threshing filled grains with simple function, which are inapplicable to high-precision and automatic yield-related traits evaluation of rice. And the conventional threshing method for the traits evaluation is still manual. To improve it, we developed a whole-feeding and automatic rice thresher for single plant. The thresher adopted a hierarchical multi-roller rolling method to thresh filled and unfilled grains respectively. A fish scale sieve plate was designed to separate the grains from the straw and the whole system was controlled by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) automatically. To evaluate the threshing system, two batches of rice plants were tested, and the results showed that the thresher had the advantages of high precision, low breakage and no residue. Thus, the thresher provides strong support for high-precision and automatic yield-related traits evaluation of rice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here we describe the application of new and existing multiplex PCR methodologies for shark species molecular identification. Four multiplex systems (group ID, thresher sharks, hammerhead sharks and miscellaneous shark) were employed with primers previously described and some designed in this study, which allow for species identification after running PCR products through an agarose gel. This system was implemented for samples (bodies and fins) collected from unidentified sharks landed in the port of Buenaventura and from confiscated tissues obtained from illegal fishing around the Malpelo Island Marine Protected Area, Pacific Coast of Colombia. This method has allowed reliable identification, to date, of 407 samples to the genus and/or species levels, most of them (380) identified as the pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus). Another seven samples were identified as scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini). This is an easy-to-implement and reliable identification method that could even be used locally to monitor shark captures in the main fishing ports of developed and developing countries.

AB  - Choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) catalyzes the conversion of choline to betaine, an important methyl donor and organic osmolyte. We have previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CHDH gene that, when present, seem to alter the activity of the CHDH enzyme. These SNPs occur frequently in humans. We created a Chdh(-/-) mouse to determine the functional effects of mutations that result in decreased CHDH activity. Chdh deletion did not affect fetal viability or alter growth or survival of these mice. Only one of eleven Chdh(-/-) males was able to reproduce. Loss of CHDH activity resulted in decreased testicular betaine and increased choline and PCho concentrations. Chdh(-/-) and Chdh(-/-) mice produced comparable amounts of sperm; the impaired fertility was due to diminished sperm motility in the Chdh(-/-) males. Transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormal mitochondrial morphology in Chdh(-/-) sperm. ATP content, total mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and inner mitochondrial membrane polarization were all significantly reduced in sperm from Chdh(-/-) animals. Mitochondrial changes were also detected in liver, kidney, heart, and testis tissues. We suggest that men who have SNPs in CHDH that decrease the activity of the CHDH enzyme could have decreased sperm motility and fertility.-Johnson, A. R., Craciunescu, C.

AB  - We estimate recent (1992-2005) trends in relative abundance for Northwest Atlantic oceanic and large coastal sharks, using generalized linear mixed models to standardize catch rates of eight species groups as recorded by U.S. pelagic longline fishery observers. Models suggest precipitous (76%) declines in hammerhead (Sphyrna species) and large coastal (dusky, night, and silky shark, genus Carcharhinus) species, and moderate declines (53%) in blue and oceanic whitetip sharks over this period. In contrast, mako and thresher sharks appear to have stabilized, and the tiger shark population appears to be increasing. A comparison of nominal shark catch rates from this fleet's observer and logbook data (to evaluate the veracity of trends previously estimated from the latter) showed a high degree of concordance for each species group, both in individual sub-areas and overall. Models of these two datasets for the common time period (1992-2000) show that compared to the observer data the logbook data indicate greater declines for some species, but lesser declines for others. Signs of recovery for some shark species are encouraging, but must also be set in the context of the significant declines that occurred in previous decades. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Based on the results of measurements of moisture content of grains, cowpea grain and pod sizes, grain-pod ratio, angle of friction of grains and some information from literature, a motorized cowpea thresher using a star-shaped beater to which beater belts were attached was designed and locally built. Five varieties of cowpea, K59, Ife-Brown, IT84E-124, Ife-Bimpe and TVX 715 which are fairly representative of the most popular varieties in Nigeria were selected for the measurement of design parameters. The statistical design used in studying the effect of variety on length, width, thickness, equivalent diameter, sphericity, pod weight and grain-pod ratio with 30 replications, moisture content with 3 replications and angle of friction with 5 replications was complete randomized design (CRD). The moisture content for the grain varieties ranged from 11.06 to 12.02% w.b while the size and shape measurement parameters namely; length, width, thickness, equivalent diameter and sphericity ranged from 8.22 to 10mm, 6.04 to 6.83 mm, 4.36 to 5.38 mm, 6.00 to 7.09 mm and 0.71 to 0.79 respectively for grains. For the pods, the length, width and thickness ranged from 124.78 to 194.93 mm, 7.28 to 9.15 mm and 5.27 to 7.86 mm respectively. The pod weight and grain-pod ratios ranged from 1.96 to 3.39 and 0.75 to 0.86 respectively for all the varieties tested while the angle of friction of grains on mild steel ranged from 23.6 degrees to 26.6 degrees. The results of the study as indicated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) show that there is highly significant effect (P 0.01) of variety on all the grains and pods measurement parameters except angle of friction where non-significance was observed. Skewness and kurtosis analysis indicates that the frequency distribution curves for grains and pods measurement parameters generally approximated those of the normal distribution. Based on the optimum machine parameters, the machine throughput was determined to be 101.19, 110.86, 74.33, 75.81 and 102.09 kg grains/hour for K59, Ife-Brown, IT84E-124, Ife-Bimpe and TVX 715 respectively. Preliminary performance evaluation tests carried out on the fabricated thresher using IT84E-124 as the test material at recommended beater and fan speeds of 500 rpm and 1400 rpm respectively indicated average threshing efficiency of 96.29%, percentage damage of 3.55% and percentage threshed and undamaged grains of 92.74%. A cleaning efficiency and loss of 95.60 and 3.71% respectively was observed indicating that with the use of a starshaped beater, drudgery and cost can be reduced to a minimum and yet achieving good quality products.

AB  - In Bangladesh, cultivable land is decreasing due to industrialization and urbanization but food demand is increasing with the increase of population. Moreover, farm labourers are migrating to non-farm jobs resulting in acute labour shortage in the peak period of farm operations. Therefore, farm mechanization becomes essential for the food security of the country. Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI), Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) and other GOs and NGOs in collaboration with the local manufacturers have been trying to introduce farm mechanization technologies in the country for the last three decades. There are some success of mechanization already found in tillage (60% by power tiller and tractor), irrigation (57% by deep tubewell, shallow tubewell and low lift pump). BRRI has developed and adopted a number of farm machines (i.e. seeders, weeders, threshers and winnower at selected sites and industries. Some of the machines such as hydro tiller, reapers (power tiller mounted and self-propelled) and dryers are under farm level trials. Awareness of farmers on using farm machines were developed in selected sites. As a result, farmers invested about Tk.1,448,500 to purchase BRRI machines from BRRI enlisted manufacturers during 20042006 and these were found profitable to use on rental basis. There are some challenges ahead to develop and adopt an appropriate rice transplanter, reaper for-low lying and marshy land, dryer, rice processing and renewable technology throughout the country for increased food production, poverty reduction and employment generation as well as improvement of socio-economic conditions of the farmers of Bangladesh.

CP  - CIGR International Conference of Agricultural Engineering/Brazilian-Society-of-Agricultural-Engineering Meeting
AB  - Paddy is an important cereal crop of the state, next only to maize, during wet season as it is grown in 22.2 % of the net cultivated area with average yield of 1.7 t/ha. Research work in the development and dissemination of engineering cost effective technologies carried out to mechanize the paddy cultivation for the state can play a dominant role in augmenting and sustaining the paddy production. Seedbed preparation and puddling with power tiller rotary has enhanced the yield by 2530 % and capacity and quality of work 3-4 times with 50 % reduction in cost of operation in comparison to bullock ploughing and puddling. The practice of rota-tilling and puddling for paddy cultivation is becoming popular among the farmers of this region. Mechanical paddy transplanting by manual paddy transplanter has ensured proper crop stand and has given 2530 % increased yield compared to traditional sowing. Serrated sickle for harvesting paddy has given 25-35 % higher capacity as compared to plain sickle. Similarly, weeding and threshing operations by cono weeder and different types of paddy threshers has produced better results and has save labour and time. This means that the various operations needed for paddy cultivation have to be mechanized, not necessarily with the costly automatic equipment, but with suitable improved implements suited to local hilly conditions.

TI  - Improvement of the modified grain thresher for groundnut threshing
T2  - AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
LA  - English
AB  - After successful modification of the Oztarim grain thresher for groundnut threshing, other parts were designed to improve its threshing operation efficiency, to facilitate automatic collection of crop residue for animal feeding and to solve the problem of soil particles accumulation underneath the thresher shaker. This was achieved through the design of a conveyor feeding belt, a cyclone vines collector and soil particle handcarts. Their specifications were identified. The improved and modified thresher with conveyor feeding belt was compared with the modified grain thresher with direct feeding, commercial thresher as a stationary thresher and manual threshing as the traditional threshing method in the Gezira scheme.
   Results indicated significant differences (P = 0.05) between the threshing methods for the required manhrs/ha and between threshing machines for fuel consumption/ha. The improved modified thresher resulted in savings of about 2 man-hrs/ha and about 3 liter/ha of fuel consumption compared to the modified grain thresher with direct feeding. The use of a conveyor feeding belt increased the material capacity of the modified grain thresher with direct feeding from 41 % to 64 % as compared to the commercial thresher with no significant difference in cleaning efficiency. Manual threshing resulted in significantly lower cleaning efficiency. The cyclone vine collector resulted in savings of about 2 min/ sack, which was the time for manual bagging of vines, and in a significant (P = 0.05) reduction in the required number of sacks/ha in comparison with manual filling operation. The use of handcarts for soil particle removal allowed continuous working of the improved thresher without changing its position near the groundrutt heap. Therefore, the designed parts could be recommended for the modified grain thresher to improve its groundnut threshing performance.

AB  - The pelagic thresher shark, Alopias pelagicus, is a cosmopolitan species and abundant in Taiwan waters. Some of its biological information has been documented yet its population dynamics are poorly known. The purpose of this study is to assess the pelagic thresher shark stock status in the eastern Taiwan waters. The whole weights (W) of 51,748 individuals of the pelagic thresher shark landed at Nanfanao and Chengkung fish markets, eastern Taiwan from 1990 to 2004 were converted to precaudal length (PCC) based on the W-PCL relationship (W = 2.25 x 10(-4) x PCL2.533, n = 2165). The sexes combined VBGE L-t = 189.5 x (1 - e(-0.10(t+6.47))) was used to estimate the age for each length group. Total mortality rates (Z) obtained with length-converted catch curves ranged from 0.208 to 0.277 year(-1). Natural mortality rate (M) estimated from Hoenig method was 0.132 year(-1), and exploitation rate (E) ranged from 0.069 to 0.127 for 1990-2004. Annual abundance was estimated to range from 97,551 in 2000 to 153,331 in 2003 from virtual population analysis, and the highest fishing mortality occurred in ages 8-18 years. There were four different scenarios being simulated in this study. Scenario I indicated that spawning per recruit (SPR) ranged from 23.07% in 2001 to 47.71% in 1990 with a mean of 36.41% for the period of 1990-2004. The mean SPR of pelagic thresher for 1990-2004 was below the BRP of SPR = 35% in scenarios 2-4 suggesting that this stock was slightly overexploited. Therefore, to ensure sustainable utilization of this stock, reduction of fishing effort and close monitoring on A. pelagicus are needed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CP  - 2006 USENIX Annual Technical Conference
AB  - A new generation of storage systems exploit decreasing storage costs to allow applications to take snapshots of past states and retain them for long durations. Over time, current snapshot techniques can produce large volumes of snapshots. Indiscriminately keeping all snapshots accessible is impractical, even if raw disk storage is cheap, because administering such large-volume storage is expensive over a long duration. Moreover, not all snapshots are equally valuable. Thresher is a new snapshot storage management system, based on novel copy-on-write snapshot techniques, that is the first to provide applications the ability to discriminate among snapshots efficiently. Valuable snapshots can remain accessible or stored with faster access while less valuable snapshots are discarded or moved off-line. Measurements of the Thresher prototype indicate that the new techniques are efficient and scalable, imposing minimal (4%) performance penalty on expected common workloads.

AB  - The spectrophotometric parameters of the main hemoglobin forms, deoxy-, oxy-, and carboxyhemoglobin, were studied in representatives of cartilaginous ganoids (giant sturgeon), elasmobranches (piked dogfish, thresher), and bony fish (the Mediterranean horse mackerel). It was established that the hemoglobin absorption spectra in the studied fish species do not have distinct specific features with respect to positions of maxima of absorption bands, their number, and extinctions. There were differences revealed in the process of deoxygenation of oxyhemoglobin in cartilaginous fish, on one hand, and cartilaginous ganoids and bony fish, on the other hand. Incomplete deoxygenation of the piked dogfish oxyhemoglobin appears to be due to the presence of two hemoglobin fractions with different values of the Bohr effect.

AB  - Do verse forms have ideologies? Stephen Duck's unwitting affirmation of the current socioeconomic order in "The Threshers Labour" seems to imply that the heroic couplet has a necessary connection to a hierarchical and authoritative universe, just as Duck uses the couplet to convey rather than betray his class-based anguish. These moments of control suggest what Mary Colliers more consistent success in "The Womans Labour" more forcefully supports: the most dominant verse from in the eighteenth century does not have an essential ideology. The two poems remind us that though verse forms can support powerful patterns and tendencies, their meanings must be derived from actual practice.

AB  - To clarity the amount of shark landing by both species and fishing methods in Japan, an investigation on shark landing at the main fishing ports was conducted. The annual average weight of landing in the product form for all shark species and blue shark by all fishing methods from 1992 to 1998 were estimated to be 19,600 and 11,600 tons respectively. Those by the longline were estimated to be 15,000 and 11,000 tons respectively. These weights became 28,700, 18,800, 23,400 and 17,800 tons after conversion to whole body weight. In all cases, the landing of the blue shark was dominant and occupied 61-79%. Excluding the blue shark, salmon shark, shortfin mako and thresher sharks were landed in relatively large amounts and occupied about 10, 10 and 5% respectively. A declining tendency in the amount of landing for those main species was not observed.

AB  - Overexploitation threatens the future of many large vertebrates. In the ocean, tunas and sea turtles are current conservation concerns because of this intense pressure. The status of most shark species, in contrast, remains uncertain. Using the largest data set in the Northwest Atlantic, we show rapid large declines in large coastal and oceanic shark populations. Scalloped hammerhead, white, and thresher sharks are each estimated to have declined by over 75% in the past 15 years. Closed-area models highlight priority areas for shark conservation, and the need to consider effort reallocation and site selection if marine reserves are to benefit multiple threatened species.

AB  - We examined the stomach contents of seven pelagic fish species collected by long-line in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean: yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, bigeye tuna T obesus, swordfish Xiphias gladius, striped marlin Tetrapturus audax, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, lancetfish Alepisaurus ferox, and pelagic thresher Alopias pelagicus. Fifty fish species from 31 families were identified in 222 stomachs examined. The choice of prey fish was very similar between bigeye tuna and swordfish, yellowfin tuna and swordfish, yellowfin tuna and dolphinfish, and big eye tuna and pelagic thresher. In contrast, similarity was low between striped marlin and lancetfish, dolphinfish and pelagic thresher, and lancetfish and pelagic thresher. According to the habitat depth range of prey fish, the seven predator species were divided into three groups: (i) wide range feeders from surface to midwater (yellowfin tuna and striped marlin); (ii) epipelagic feeders (dolphinfish); and (iii) midwater (mesopelagic) feeders (bigeye tuna, swordfish, lancetfish, and pelagic thresher). The most important prey fish belonged to the following families: Sternoptychidae, Phosichthyidae, Paralepididae, Omosudidae, Myctophidae, Exocoetidae, Hemiramphidae, Bramidae, Gempylidae, and Scombridae. Although pelagic fish predators extensively use these prey families, different dominant families and feeding depths of each predator are considered to reduce trophic competition among pelagic fish in the eastern equatorial Pacific.

AB  - The petals of marigold flowers (Tagetes erecta) are commonly used as a feed supplement by the poultry industry to enhance broiler skin and yolk coloration. This research examined the effectiveness of a threshing device for removing petals from Orange Lady marigold flowers by scrubbing dried flowers between two moving plates. Thresher-associated independent variables were plate speed and distance between plates (plate gap). Flower moisture content was the independent variable representing flower properties. Efficacy was determined by measuring the threshing efficiencies and the percent trash (MOP, material other than petals) present in the threshed material. Results show smaller plate gaps had higher threshing efficiencies and increased MOP in the harvested samples. Threshing efficiencies ranged from 34% to 98% for high and low flower moisture contents respectively. Plate speeds ranging from 156 to 936 mm/sec had no effect on threshing efficiency.

AB  - The sequence of the mu opioid receptor is highly conserved among human, rat, and mouse. In order to gain insights into the evolution of the mu opioid receptor, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen genomic DNA from a number of different species using degenerate oligonucleotides which recognize a highly conserved region. DNA was assayed from representative species of both the protostome and deuterostome branches of the metazoan phylogenetic tree. Mu opioid receptor-like sequences were found in all vertebrate species chat were analyzed. These species included bovine, chicken, bullfrog, striped bass, thresher shark, and Pacific hagfish. However, no mu opioid receptorlike sequences were detected from protostomes or from any invertebrates. The PCR results demonstrate that the region of the mu opioid receptor gene between the first intracellular loop and the third transmembrane domain (TM3) has been highly conserved during evolution and that mu opioid receptor-like sequences are present in the earliest stages of vertebrate evolution. Additional opioid receptor-like sequence was obtained from mRNA isolated from Pacific hagfish brain using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The sequence of the Pacific hagfish was most homologous with the human mu opioid receptor (72% at the amino acid level between intracellular loop 1 and transmembrane domain 6) although over the same region high homology was also observed with the delta opioid receptor (69%), the kappa receptor (63%), and opioid receptor-like (ORL1) (59%). The hag-fish sequence showed low conservation with the mammalian opioid receptors in the first and second extracellular loops but high conservation in the transmembrane and intracellular domains.

AB  - Thermal stability and gel-forming ability of silvertip, hammer-head and thresher shark as affected by ionic strength were investigated. Low temperature endothermic peaks (LTEP, between 30 and 44 degrees C) were observed in differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermograms of the shark muscles and surimi samples. Increases in ionic strength reduced the thermal stability of surimi as shown by depression of transition temperature, denaturation enthalpies and LTEP. Although gel strength of heat-treated surimi increased with increasing NaCl concentration, the three species had different sensitivities to ionic strength. The highest NaCl-induced gel-forming ability of surimi was achieved at 0.5M salt concentration for silvertip and thresher; at 1.0M for hammer-head shark.

AB  - Economic reform has been on the Egyptian policy agenda since the mid-1970s. But progress has been slow in part due to strong regulatory and institutional obstacles. The experience of the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry displays this problem. An economic analysis of manufacturing threshers shows that while the impact of price policies was about neutral, institutional barriers effectively taxed the industry 15-22%. The greatest obstacle was access to marketing credit from the state-owned Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit. Access to materials and difficulties with tax authorities also hampered the industry.

TI  - TROPICAL PASTURE ESTABLISHMENT .5. IMPROVED HANDLING OF CHAFFY GRASS SEEDS - OPTIONS, OPPORTUNITIES AND VALUE
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
LA  - English
KW  - MORPHOLOGY
KW  - DISPERSAL
AB  - Many useful grasses have 'chaffy' seeds characterised by a range of appendages: awns, sterile spikelets, and surface hairs or bristles. En masse, chaffy seeds are light and bully, and do not flow freely because the individual units tend to become entangled. These attributes add to costs of seed cleaning, testing, storage and transport, and make it impossible to sow chaffy seeds evenly through conventional seeders.
   Examples are given of the structural diversity among chaffy grass seeds. The functions of hygroscopic awns and other appendages during establishment are examined, indicating situations where intact seeds (including chaffy appendages) should be sown, and others where structural modification to improve seed handling and distribution would enhance establishment.
   Processing methods to remove some or all of the chaffy appendages are reviewed. Machinery available includes hammer mills, de-bearders, brush polishers and de-awners, and cone, belt and filament threshers, as well as equipment for flame treatment and aerodynamic conditioning. Trimming of the normal chaffy seed units is generally preferable to the complete removal of caryopses, especially where caryopses are tightly held within the surrounding floral husk. Leaving a protective husk around the caryopsis reduces the risk of physical damage during processing and improves the reliability of field establishment under marginal moisture conditions.
   Processing removes 40% or more of the original weight as inert matter. The advantages of higher seed quality and more uniform seed delivery during sowing, as well as the compensatory effect of lower seeding rates on costs per hectare, should be emphasised in price-sensitive markets. In some situations, artificial coatings applied to processed seeds may also facilitate sowing and improve the competitive ability of establishing seedlings.

TI  - LABOR-SAVING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE JAVANESE RICE ECONOMY - RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND A LOOK INTO THE 1990S
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Rising labour costs and declining terms of trade for rice farmers on Java during the 1980s have encouraged the adoption of labour-saving technologies. This paper uses extensive field survey evidence to illustrate current patterns of labour-displacing technological change in the Javanese rice economy. It presents the recent introduction of pre-emergence herbicides as a potential revolution in labour-saving technologies, comparable to that of small rice mills and sickles. The evidence shows that the growing use of tractors and machine threshers is further reducing labour inputs. These changes will have a profound effect on the role of women in rice agriculture. The paper compares the transition in the Javanese rice economy with that experienced elsewhere in Asia, and shows that the adoption of labour-saving technologies has occurred more slowly on Java than in other countries in the region.
